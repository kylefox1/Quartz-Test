To go over the big vision again or defining the impact, the goal is to:
get people to realize the value of their data and exercise sovereignty over it and their vehicle/devices (a la right to repair movement) in a way that can also be sustainable (environmental- and health-wise) So, putting this in theory of change (ToC) language, this could be:</description></item><item><title>ass'n stuff</title><link>https://kylefox1.github.io/Garden-1/Bikestream-2021_1113-V0.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kylefox1.github.io/Garden-1/Bikestream-2021_1113-V0.1/</guid><description>REI Cooperative Action Fund I sent an email asking the Fund to review the Bikestream project as a potential grantee.
I think Bikestream has a good chance because it can encourage people to go outdoors to cycle, and also an educational side on making people aware of the value of managing their data and micro-mobiltiy vehicles.
I really like this grantee, Black Girls Do Bike . Additionally, it is making me think that I should make (preferrably someone else) an event where people with converted e-bikes with BikePis race with each other.</description></item><item><title>ass'n stuff</title><link>https://kylefox1.github.io/Garden-1/Bikestream-2021_1117-V0.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kylefox1.github.io/Garden-1/Bikestream-2021_1117-V0.1/</guid><description>Data Storage The BikePi can also be used for storing vehicle and geolocation data (or any sensor data that is manipulated by the BikePi) on the IPFS.
