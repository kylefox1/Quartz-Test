To go over the big vision again or defining the impact, the goal is to:

I think Bikestream has a good chance because it can encourage people to go outdoors to cycle, and also an educational side on making people aware of the value of managing their data and micro-mobiltiy vehicles.
I really like this grantee, Black Girls Do Bike .
