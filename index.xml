They cover many areas so drafting has been a bit harder than I would like (T_T).
Hopefully, I can get some of these out by the end of October. I will probably start with the GTC and Data Commons articles.
Alternatively, I might turn these into podcasts.

I think the topic will be convergence, convergent research and global tech commonwealth (GTC), with an example of convergence to thematically set up the conference, and 4 sessions:
