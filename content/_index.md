# Charles Adjovu's Digital Garden

Hi! Welcome to my digital garden. Here you will find my scratch work on ideas I am thinking about.

This site is based on [Jacky Zhao's](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening) [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) theme for Hugo.

This digital garden is primarily for my work on/for the [Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative](https://www.ledgerback.coop/).

I am [drawn to working on many things at once](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1444630757863952393), so do not expect all of these notes to be connected.

## A simple categorisation system based on [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) 

-   topic tags
-   start and end date
-   a stage tag: 
	-   üå± _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas
	-   üåø _Budding_ for work I've cleaned up and clarified
	-   üå≥ _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).
-   a confidence  tag: how likely it is the overall ideas are right
-   a credibility tag: how well-supported the essay is,
-   1-10 importance tag: how important (impact) I think  the idea is to myself, society, scholarship, or industry

## NILS V2.0

Here are my preliminary notes and work on an update to [Nested Inter-Linkage Systems (NILS)](https://ledgerback.substack.com/p/ldcrc-roadmap-2020-21-nested-inter).

I will be writing V2.X updates in chunks rather than one finished essay.

Send your feedback to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CAdjovu) account.

## DGov Score Framework (DGov Score)

Quick update on the DGov Score, a framework of rating systems for digital organizations and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

I am trying a new version of the assessment based on the Framework that disconnects the organizing principles of DAOs from:

1. Other digital organizations, 
2. Participant experience, and
2. Performance.

Will this lead to a [decentralized, polycentric, democratic system of legitimacy](https://samoburja.com/intellectual-legitimacy/)?
