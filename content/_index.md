# Charles Adjovu's Digital Garden

Hi! Welcome to my digital garden.

This site is based on [Jacky Zhao's](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening) [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) theme for Hugo.

This digital garden is primarily for my work on/for the Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative.

## NILS V2.0

Here are my preliminary notes and work on an update to [Nested Inter-Linkage Systems (NILS)](https://ledgerback.substack.com/p/ldcrc-roadmap-2020-21-nested-inter).

I will be writing V2.X updates in chunks rather than one finished essay.

Send your feedback to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CAdjovu) account.
