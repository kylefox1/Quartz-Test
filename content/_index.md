# Charles Adjovu's Digital Garden

Hi! Welcome to my digital garden. Here you will find my scratch work on ideas I am thinking about.

This site is based on [Jacky Zhao's](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening) [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) theme for Hugo.

This digital garden is primarily for my work on/for the [Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative](https://www.ledgerback.coop/) ("LDCRC", "Association").

I am drawn to working on [(too) many things at once](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1444630757863952393) and running through a [learning/research/product portfolio](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/hyper-learning), so do not expect all of these notes to be connected. Uusually the best bet for traversing this digital garden is running through the [directories](##Directories) listed below.

## Current “main” projects

- [Observatory](./Garden-1/Knowledgebases-2021_0925-V0.1.md):  a database monitoring pluralistic actors, organizations, movements, events, protocols, networks and more in the Ledgerback Frontier (i.e., Decentralized Web (DWeb) and related fields). 
	- Glossary 
	- People
	- Tools
- [Networked Cognitive Cooperative Institute (NC2I)](): a potential strategic plan and institutional-ecosystem model for the LDCRC
- [Bikestream](): a project to help people see the benefits of valuing and managing their data and vehicles (can extend to electronic devices in general)
- [Laplace](): a learning & research (and tools) content aggregator and platform for hackathons (also to develop courses) and micro-consulting, and visualizing and building an expert graph of knowledge at the Ledgerback Frontier. 
- [Distroid](https://distroid.substack.com/): a knowledge curation service similar to [TheSyllabus](https://twitter.com/syllabus_tweets)
- [Awards](./Garden-1/Awards-2021_1022-V0.1.md): awards to recognize individual and group work at the Ledgerback Frontier 
- [DGov Score Framework's (DGov Score)](): a project to develop the theoretical background for understanding organizational structures and developing tools to analyze organizations, with an emphasis on digital organizations, self-management and -organization, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Currently focused on making the DAO Index Survey.
- [Global Technological Commonwealth (GTC) Index]() `on hold`: an index to help measure progress towards the GTC
- [Conceptualizing Research Cooperatives](https://medium.com/p/research-cooperatives-part-1-conceptualization-616a7b155190): some thoughts on whether research cooperatives are their own type of cooperative. I think this is an emerging type of cooperative that will become more common as the web grows. 
- [Networked-trust Cooperatives (NTC)](./Garden-1/NILS-V2-2021_0921-V0.1.md): A digital/platform cooperative for developing trust networks for digital identity and interchange schemas so that online communtiies can create, manage, and share interoperable reputation systems, and monetize reputational work.
- [Ledgerback Frontier Portal](./Garden-1/LedgerbackPortal-2021_1005-V0.1.md): a gateway to the Decentralized Web (DWeb) and related fields (i.e., Ledgerback Frontier). The aim of the portal is to help people start diving into the DWeb, especially from a convergence perspective (so expect beginner resources across a wide swath of topics), and hopefully cause a paradigm shift towards blockchain thinking and beyond.
- [Noggin](): a project to develop decision-making/reasoning tools for thought (TfT) for individuals and collectives (similar to Ought)

experiments & surprises in between

I will be writing more about the projects here and on some project-specific newsletters.

I am mostly working on curating resources at the moment for the Observatory and docs for the LDCRC.

## A simple categorisation system based on [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) 

**Retired**
```markdown
-   topic tags
-   start and end date
-   a stage tag: 
	-   🌱 _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas
	-   🌿 _Budding_ for work I've cleaned up and clarified
	-   🌳 _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).
-   a confidence  tag: how likely it is the overall ideas are right
-   a credibility tag: how well-supported the essay is,
-   1-10 importance tag: how important (impact) I think  the idea is to myself, society, scholarship, or industry 
```

### 2021-11-17 Update

I am changing my *stage tag* to states of matter (gas -> plasma -> liquid -> solid). I will be updating the pages to reflect this change.

```markdown
-   topic tags
-   start and end date
-   a stage tag: 
	-   _Gas_ for very rough and early ideas
	-   _Plasma_ for work I've cleaned up but is still rough
	-   _Liquid_ for work that is reasonably a first draft (though I still tend these over time).
	-   _Solid_ for work that is reasonably complete (a working draft to final draft) and I expect will have few updates in the future
-   a confidence  tag: how likely it is the overall ideas are right
-   a credibility tag: how well-supported the essay is,
-   1-10 importance tag: how important (impact) I think  the idea is to myself, society, scholarship, or industry

Here are my preliminary notes and thoughts on an update to the [Nested Inter-Linkage Systems (NILS)](https://ledgerback.substack.com/p/ldcrc-roadmap-2020-21-nested-inter) institutional-ecosystem model.

I will be writing V2.X updates in chunks rather than one finished essay.

### DGov Score Framework (DGov Score)


2. [DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_1111-V0.1](./Garden-1/DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_1111-V0.1.md): Updates on a design for a certification mark, survey design for DAO index and first analysis under the survey on [dOrg](https://www.dorg.tech/#/), and future thoughts on an open rating system based on the DAO Index
2. [Introducing the DAO Index](./Garden-1/DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1): My first update on the project since April/May 2020 for work on a a new version of the assessment based on the Framework that disconnects the organizing principles of DAOs from: 1) other digital organizations, 2) participant experience, and 3) performance. I explain the need for a new survey design and the organizing principles or dimensions that I believe bring all DAOs together. Additionally, some very informative readings that helped me rethink the project and get back to putting some work on it. 
	1. Readings
		1. [Is a DAO a Panopticon? Algorithmic governance as creating and mitigating vulnerabilities in "Decentralised Autonomous Organisations"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3907693)
		2. [ A Prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)	
3. [Github Repository](): The Github repo stores the docs for the project before my work on the DAO Index. You can find most of the theoretical background for the project here. 

Some immediate questions that come to mind with this project:

1. Will this lead to a [decentralized, polycentric, or democratic system of legitimacy](https://samoburja.com/intellectual-legitimacy/)?
2. Will this project lead to expertise network effects? 
3. Can this project help grow the DAO ecosystem?
4. Can this project help everyday people better understand DAOs?

# Papers

1. [Blockchain and the Rise of the Internet Cooperative](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3750540)

```markdown
Cooperatives and blockchain projects appear to be unrelated until a deeper look is taken into
blockchain projects and their associated communities. Cooperatives and blockchain projects both
promote substantially similar principles and values centered around democratic member control
and the freedom for individuals to come together for their own mutual benefit. There are two
types of cooperativism which expressly account for the ability for blockchain to further
cooperatives, platform cooperativism and open cooperativism. Further, decentralized
autonomous organizations (DAOs), take the combination of blockchain and cooperativism even
further through the cooperative management of an entity that is created on, managed on, and
solely exists on a blockchain. the inner workings of blockchain make it extremely suitable for
meeting the seven principles and values that unite cooperatives across the world and for
expanding cooperative values and principles from local communities to global movements.
