# Charles Adjovu's Digital Garden

Hi! Welcome to my digital garden.

This site is based on [Jacky Zhao's](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening) [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) theme for Hugo.

## NILS V2.0

Here are my preliminary notes and work on an update to [Nested Inter-Linkage Systems (NILS)](https://ledgerback.substack.com/p/ldcrc-roadmap-2020-21-nested-inter).

I will be writing V2.X updates in chunks rather than one finished essay.

Send your feedback to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CAdjovu) account.

## DGov Score Framework (DGov Score)

Quick update on the DGov Score

I am trying a new version of the assessment based on the Framework that disconnects the organizing principles of DAOs from:

1. Other digital organizations, 
2. Participant experience, and
2. Performance.
