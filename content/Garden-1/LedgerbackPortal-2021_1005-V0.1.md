# About

The Ledgerback portal is a gateway to the decentralized internet. The aim of the portal is to help you start dive into the decentralized internet (and eventually GTC and HCI), especially from a convergence perspective (so expect beginner resources across a wide swath of topics), and hopefully cause a paradigm shift in your thinking.

  

## Discoverability 

  

The Ledgerback portal is:

  

-   A gateway into the world of the decentralized internet (including blockchain, platform cooperativist)
    
-   An explorable and fun platform to safely discover projects and teams
    
-   A browser plugin to accompany people on their voyage beyond the platform (in the pipeline
    
-   A place for teachers to find resources to use in their own courses
    

  

## Security

  

The Ledgerback portal will:

  

-   Guide people to community-verified projects and teams
    
-   Help people take responsibility for their own security
    
-   Collaborate with teams and connect with existing data and tech across the ecosystem
