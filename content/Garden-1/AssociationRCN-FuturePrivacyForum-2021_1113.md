> The Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) with the support of the [National Science Foundationâ€™s Research Coordination Network](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-coordination-networks), engages with academic professionals to bring state-of-the-art research to industry privacy practitioners. Through this program, FPF strives to facilitate research collaborations and coordination by providing a high-profile platform for academic researchers to connect with corporate privacy leaders.

>[At a time when industry actors are the custodians of a wide range of consumer data, bringing together corporate and academic constituents is critical to making practical privacy progress. FPF has hosted webinars, conferences, and working group meetings to give academics a platform to present their research. Academic articles are also shared through summaries of privacy scholarship.](https://fpf.org/research-coordination-network/)

Realy interesting RCN here as well. I will update the NC2I's RCN section if need be. 

Also look through NSF's [program](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-coordination-networks) and [contacts](https://www.nsf.gov/bio/ef/rcn_contacts.htm).

Also a good example of offering a [training program](https://fpf.org/training/) (and courses thereunder)

> [Rather, the RCN program supports the means by which investigators can share information and ideas, coordinate ongoing or planned research activities, foster synthesis and new collaborations, develop community standards, and in other ways advance science and education through communication and sharing of ideas.](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-coordination-networks)

- this is good for the Association because this will allow the Ass'n to be a meta-connector
	- also can help bring connections for members so they can find more people to work with
- *oy vey, another thing to apply for*
