## What is the Global Technological Commonwealth?

In [Distributed Ledger Technologies, Value Accounting, and the Self Sovereign Identity](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.00029/full), Dr. Sarah Manski describes the global technological commonwealth (GTC) as:

> [a] shared imaginary consist[ing] of a post-capitalist society where communities of mutual interest cooperate in the construction of institutions of regenerative economic relations. 

 The technological design principles of the GTC include:

>→ Technological design should incorporate planetary boundaries

>→ Technological design should be modeled on natural biological ecosystems

>→ Technological design should enable the redefinition of value (ex. Distributed Value Accounting)

>→ Technological design should enable radically democratic coordination and governance

>→ Technological design should allow for the growth of a cooperative commons as the desirable future.

### How to measure progress towards the GTC?

This is my primary question and the main motivator for the Ledgerback school.[^1] 

Some recent papers that have come out which I think may help are:

1. [Challenges and Approaches to Scaling the Global Commons](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.578721/full),
2. [A Route to Commons-Based Democratic Monies? Embedding the Governance of Money in Traditional Communal Institutions](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.575851/full#h1), and
3. [Analysis of the Potentials of Blockchain for the Governance of Global Digital Commons](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.577680/full#h1)
4. [No Gods, No Masters, No Coders? The Future of Sovereignty in a Blockchain World](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/56826053/Manski-Manski2018_Article_NoGodsNoMastersNoCodersTheFutu-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1632933868&Signature=azOVZ0wMzwciO34w1KM7vP9cpAbCRkW8RbcyOgAeO0xbQBl6F~fg0Yg3EUnZ0qpkV8iYm-ipELjoXgf6nzvOTTIQ3SlyDtlc0RJSYb5f2dh5K6X0PL5pW4gvaOgnFXqNXrd1DC8tlAJNAqzUTP-JwJp2WIBQvROPJ49xuK6w6y33qlW1cr4ETMSC8SJStSkPAcUEAbSi2iD-a9XvDWc7cu1MDe1VDZTAuu3X2gKFrsYzXdY3mdHHdXVP~9nD6QPM-fOL~nQqSY9oZ~Z2lQJ0w9VeszaHapWqV2PQjLFKFRArSsMeXARU9HVCQQi4wzRFkNnOt~~L4aK~51DThuCKOQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA)

I think we can measure progress by using these indicators: 

1. Count/growth of interoperable solutions (blockchain bridges, Cosmos, metaverse) 
3. Count/growth of Currencies beyond money
4. Count/growth of Contribution-tracking methods
5. Count/growth of (should *use* be included?) Commons-oriented organizations and tools (does this include OrgTech?)
6. Count/growth of (should *use* be included?) of privacy-preserving/portable data systems (e.g., PDS, Blockchain-based DID)?
7. Count/growth of educational, grey or academic materials (especially convergent materials) 
8. Count/growth of public goods
9. Count/growth of events

I think these indicators are consistent with the GTC's Definition and Design Principles.

All in all, I think I will name this the GTC Index (GTCI).

#### Using the indicators

I will be making a spreadsheet for the GTCI.

#### Sub-Q: Which indicators to use?

Use jeff emmett manski paper here

-   develop a convergent knowledge-base  
       
    - Amplify individual and collective intelligence (tools for thought)  
       
    - Develop spaces to connect polymaths, citizens, systems-thinkers, and inter/cross-disciplinary teams  
       
    - Community to learn about alt. Internet  
       
    - Matchmaking ideas-to-ideas and actors-to-ideas and actors-to-actors
%%
#### Resources to aid the progress

I think some resources that can help are:

1. a convergent knowledgebase (*not sure if P2Pwiki does not already cover this one*),
	1. content
		1. How-to's and guides 
		2. Academic & Grey literature
		3. etc.
	2. directories
		1. people
		2. organizations
		3. tools
		4. databases
2. commons-in-a-box (CIAB) tools,
3. Matchmaking/Connectivity services,
	1.  ideas-to-ideas, 
	2.  actors-to-ideas, and 
	3.  actors-to-actors
4. Conferences and other events, and
5. Online schools (e.g., cadCAD course)

## What is convergence?

> The connection and integration of major areas in the alternative internet (i.e., decentralized web). Like an inter-*XYZ* %%?toward a common goal?%%

I am primarily focused on convergence concerning:

- democratic ownership models
- social technology
- tools for thought
- networked-scholarship (web-based research + citizen science)


In the alternative internet, an example would be  Web3 (specifically blockchain tech) and cooperatives. A blockchain cooperative, e.g., [Eva Cooperative](https://www.eva.coop/), *integrates* democratic ownership structures with Web3 technologies into a single organization or federation. 

A *connection* example can be seen between platform cooperativism and Web3 via: 

1. Nathan Schneider's [Exit to Community](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73),
2. Jesse Walden’s [The Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/), and 
3. Kei Kreutler's [A Prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q).




### What is convergent research?

### How can convergence get us to GTC?

Some possible ways:

1. Matching people at the edge of disciplines or movements togehter to work on things.
2. Help see where we are divided community- and knowledge -wise and connect knoowledgebases and people to develop convergent soltuions that can solve multi-faceted problems from multiple angles. 
3. Additionally, develop research questions from multiple disciplines on one or more themes so that scholars can work individually to solve issues inntheir domian, and then those solutions aids the collective of scholars because the problems can be tackled from multiple angles, the concerns of scolars all match up so their solutions can be combined like legos, and collective progress can be made toward the complex issue.
