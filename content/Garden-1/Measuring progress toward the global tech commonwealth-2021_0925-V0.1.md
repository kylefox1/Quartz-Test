### Measuring progress toward the global tech commonwealth

How to get to GTC:

-   develop a convergent knowledge-base  
       
    - Amplify individual and collective intelligence (tools for thought)  
       
    - Develop spaces to connect polymaths, citizens, systems-thinkers, and inter/cross-disciplinary teams  
       
    - Community to learn about alt. Internet  
       
    - Matchmaking ideas-to-ideas and actors-to-ideas and actors-to-actors

### What is convergence?

The connection and integration of areas toward a common goal?

In the alternative internet, an example would be a blockchain cooperative. A a blockchain cooperative, e.g., Eva Cooperative, combines democratic ownership structures with Web3 technologies into a single organization or federation.

Eva Cooperative because Eva combines a platform cooperative with Web3 technology.

### What is convergent research?

### How can convergence get us to GTC?

Matching people at the edge of disciplines or movements togeter to work on things

Help see where we are divided community- and knoowledge -wise and connect knoowledgebases and people to develop convergent soltuions that can solve multi-faceted problems from multiple angles. 

Additionally, develop research questions from multiple disciplines on one or more themes so that scholars can work individually to solve issues inntheir domian, and then those solutions aids the collective of scholars because the problems can be tackled from multiple angles, the concerns of scolars all match up so their solutions can be combined like legos, and collective progress can be made toward the complex issue.
