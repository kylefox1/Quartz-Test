# Fund

Fund also acts as a market for connecting donors and grantees (likely experts). 

This can be how we get philanthropsits ([additionally by giving them access to a People table](https://www.reviewercredits.com/editorial-services/)). 

Fund can operate like [REI Cooperative Action Fund](https://www.reifund.org/donors)

# [Make a Donation!](https://www.reifund.org/donate)

The power of one person to make a difference in the world always rings true. That one person, joined by hundreds of thousands of others with a shared vision, is unstoppable.

**Together**, we can uplift equitable access to thriving outdoor places.  
**Together**, we can honor the communities working to create a new outdoor culture.  
**Together**, we can activate the work to better understand how time spent in nature improves health and well-being.   
**Together**, we can deliver on our conviction that spending time outdoors is a human right. For everyone.   
Imagine the difference we can make if even a fraction of the REI Co-op community, along with friends, donate to the REI Cooperative Action Fund.

Thanks to REI Co-op’s generous support this year, 100% of your gift* goes to the Fund’s grantees.
