I read this article by [Rob Haisfield](https://www.twitter.com/RobertHaisfield) on [HyperLearning](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/hyper-learning) and felt that it heavily resonated with my own thoughts. As you can tell by the mess my digital garden is, I run through a project portfolio to further understand the DWeb and have somewhat of a foot in every major area. Though it is messy, it really does help me see the intersections and convergence that is possible in the DWeb to find the people and solutions to address pressing societal, technical, environmental, and scientific problems.
