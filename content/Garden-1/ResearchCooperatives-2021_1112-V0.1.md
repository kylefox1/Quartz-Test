Charlie Fisher raised an interesting point that a research cooperative might make more sense as a [Focused Research Organization (FRO)](https://convergentresearch.org/fro). 

Additionally, another additional type of research+ (or service being provided) is an *inventors cooperative.*

A research cooperative can also have elements of an inventors cooperative by providing services to determine feasibility and manufature of an idea like [Quirky](https://quirky.com/).
