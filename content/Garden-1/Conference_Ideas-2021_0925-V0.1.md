# Conf Ideas
Here are some thoughts on a conference I have been thinking about  for the past 2 months.

I think the topic will be convergence, convergent research and global tech commonwealth (GTC), with an example of convergence to thematically set up the conference, and 4 sessions:

1. Presentations 
2. Ideation (pick themes and generate questions)
3. Workflows (tutorials, personal workflows)
4. Application (hackathon)

## Why?

I am also working on the need or *the why* for the conference.

I think the lack of similar conferences might work.

# Other Conferences

Conferences I am examining in setting up the conference are:

1. [Metascience](https://metascience2021.org/)
2. [Knowledge Graph Conference](https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/)
3. [WAIM]()
