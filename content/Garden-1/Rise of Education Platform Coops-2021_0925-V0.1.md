The International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) defines a cooperative as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” [2].

The cooperative model is an ownership model that can work with various business models.

The seven cooperative principles are:

1. Voluntary and Open Membership,

2. Democratic Member Control,

3. Member Economic Participation,

4. Autonomy and Independence,

5. Education, Training, and Information,

6. Cooperation among Cooperatives, and

7. Concern for Community [2].

A cooperative is distinguished from other organizations based on democratic governance, member-ownership, and operating for the benefit of members.

### Platform Cooperatives

“Platform cooperatives are businesses that use a website, mobile app, or protocol to sell goods or services. They rely on democratic decision-making and shared ownership of the platform by workers and users” [3].

There are four types of platform cooperatives:

1.  Data,
2.  Worker,
3.  Producer, and
4.  Multi-stakeholder [5].

### Edu Cooperatives

An education cooperative is a cooperative that provides educational services or products to members (producer) or non-members (consumers).

An online/digital education cooperative is a type of platform cooperative [2].

  

### Why alternatives?

Edu cooperatives have risen in response to …

-   increasing popularity of e-learning [1]
-   freelance teachers’ pay has failed to increase as e-learning has become popular [1]
-   platform owners accruing more value through rents [1] 
-   freelance teacher’s lack of control over bookings and schedules and cancellation policies[1]
-   inflexible cancellation policies that make it difficult for freelance teachers to cancel within 24 hours. Those who do cancel can get penalised. [1]
-   transaction fees are too high [1]
-   “more freedom to create their own courses and lesson plans and offer their own prices” [1]
-   lack of control over courses offered on platforms [1]
-   “discriminatory hiring practices, including paying teachers differently according to where they live or what passport they have.” [1, 2]
-   high tuition costs for students [2]
-   lack of support for marginalised communities [2]
-   “freelance teachers and professionals affected by pay cuts” [1]

#### The learning coop

description: get from about page

“The Learning Cooperative delivers affordable private tuition, while paying tutors from around the world a fair wage. We put students together with inspiring teachers in Gaza, London and Pakistan, to deliver high quality and engaging private language courses. Unlike normal private tuition, tutors are all paid an equal wage and languages are taught in their political, historical and social context.” [3].

**purpose:**

-   provide an alternative business model in the online education sector that empowers workers and confronts material inequality [2].

providers is an internationalist approach to learning, affordable private tuition and paying tutors the same wage no matter where in the world they are based.

  

**benefit:**

-   “members of the co-op say the language courses are taught in an “anti-imperialist and non-Eurocentric framework”, exploring the different dynamics that have shaped the different nations and communities that speak a specific language. The courses tend to adopt a participatory methodology, where challenging world views and exchanging ideas is strongly encouraged.” [2]
-   “paying tutors the same wage no matter where in the world they are based.” [2]
-   worker-owned and -managed [2].
-   “affordable pricing system, called the wealth test, in order to guide how much each person should be paying so that it can pay tutors and make sure everyone can afford tuition.” [2]
-   “ When cancellations occur, the students get the choice to wait for their tutor to be available and continue with their lessons with them. If the situation escalates, other measures could be proposed, such as joining classes led by other tutors.” [2]
-   “affordable one-to-one tuition for a price as low as £20/h.” [2]

#### Mycoolclass

description: get from about page

“MyCoolClass is an international teachers’ cooperative with its own online teaching platform. We connect the best teachers from around the world with the keenest learners in a fun, open and culturally diverse space. What’s more, we give teachers the chance to own their workplace.

As a worker-cooperative, we follow the seven principles set forth by the International Cooperative Alliance. We are registered in the United Kingdom as a society and members of Co-operatives UK.” [4]

**purpose:**

-   provide an alternative business model for freelance teachers and professionals were teachers have decision-making power over their schedules, the courses offered on the platform, and pricing models [1].

**benefit:**

-   “Paid sick leave will also be available after the first two or three months once the co-operative has built up enough capital, adds Mr Hayes.” [1]
-   fixed fee of 19% to cover “overheads and expenses, a contribution to a general fund, as well as their own paid time off” is less than the majority’s fee that generally start at 35% [1]
-   “The co-op will deal with admin work and bookkeeping so teachers can focus on their job.” [1]
-   Teachers can “create their own courses and lesson plans and offer their own prices. The platform will also let them bring their own students and set their own individual prices, completely separate from the marketplace.” [1]
-   “Another different feature will be a membership area within the platform where teachers can co-create, collaborate and develop short, fun-themed courses. These will then be submitted to the review board, which will be made up of the co-op’s staff of professional curriculum builders and educators, who will review the content and provide suggestions to improve the courses. Once approved, the courses will be sent to the co-op’s in-house graphic design and illustration team, to bring them to life and add them to the marketplace. 
-   Teachers will earn royalties on courses they create and sell on the marketplace [1]
-   “students will be allocated two teachers per course.” [1]
