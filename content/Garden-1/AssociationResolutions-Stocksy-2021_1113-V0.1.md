I think a resolutions system based on Stocksy United's system is doable for the Association. 

Here are some quotes from an article on [Stocksy's model](https://www.shareable.net/platform-consensus-how-stocksy-achieves-democratic-governance/):

> Members can initiate the resolution process in two clicks by posting an “idea for discussion” on a specialized platform on the Stocksy intranet. When an idea is posted, a round of voting begins automatically and a discussion space for that idea is created. “This first round of voting indicates whether or not membership believes the idea is one worth additional attention, providing a quick way to assess and prioritize ideas,” Cook says. “This gives all our members a chance to read, translate, talk about, and think about our resolutions.”

> Recent resolutions that have been put to a vote have drawn 36-40 percent turnout from members. “I thought that was low, but I’ve spoken to a lot of people who are surprised by that level of engagement,” he says. Cook says the new process has driven a healthy, substantive democratic debate among members and between members and the company’s leadership: “When you see the debate that occurs in the forums, you see how seriously this is taken by our members.”

> When an idea for discussion is first posted, members have at least seven days to vote on whether to advance it to the next step of the process. Members receive automated messages letting them know how many days are left to vote once a quorum of voters (10 percent of artist members) has been reached on any given resolution.

> When an idea for discussion has passed a member vote, the board reviews it to assess its feasibility and its potential impact on the business. Once the board accepts an idea, it passes the idea to the newly created Resolution Committee, a joint committee of board members and artist-members, which works to develop the best draft of the resolution before putting it forward for a final vote. Reminders are sent out to all members throughout the voting period, and once voting closes and votes are calculated, the results are displayed in the members’ portal.

> In theory, the board does have the power to reject an idea, but Cook says that rejection is unlikely “unless board members have a specific concern that they would like addressed.”
