### Tools for thought and cooperatives

An article on why tools for thought are infrastructural and should be managed by a coop

-   > thesis -> collect sources -> create outline -> iteratively draft

tools for thought are infrastructural and should be managed by a coop because:

1.  TfTs are quasi-public goods
2.  knowledge production is best as a CBPP activity and the cultural nature of CBPP can be preserved by coop model
3.  platform coop can provide alt. biz model for expertise nfx (tools and contests) caused by TfT
4.  platform coop encourages democratic ownership and governance of software and encourages local-first software or coop cloud
5.  ?mention universal knowledge graph?
6.  cybernetic argument like “aggregators” article?

**TfT definition**

>“A word on nomenclature: the term “tools for thought” rolls off neither the tongue nor the keyboard. What’s more, the term “tool” implies a certain narrowness. Alan Kay has arguedAgain, in Alan Kay, [User Interface: A Personal View](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf) (1989), among other places. that a more powerful aim is to develop a new _medium for thought_. A medium such as, say, Adobe _Illustrator_ is essentially different from any of the individual tools _Illustrator_ contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the possible range of human thought” [^1]
