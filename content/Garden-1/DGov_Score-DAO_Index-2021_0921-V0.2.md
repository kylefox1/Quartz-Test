# DAO-Index: Principles/Accountability Rating
Specifically for ==principles rating==.
## V0.2 Update

### Description 

Permissionless framework for quantifying the adherence towards the principles of DAOs.

DAO-Index offers a simple and comparable opinion in the form of a numerical score and percentage rating on a scale from 0 - 6,000 that represents the overall quality of a DAO's adherence to DAO  Organizing/Cultural principles from a neutral view, based on publicly available data.

The DAO-IndexRating system operates through a [permissionless process] governed by the LDCRC.

As always, send your feedback to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CAdjovu) account.

V.1 of DAO-Index evaluates DAOs from the perspective of a potential applicant  based on the 11 areas.

### **Permissionless Rating**

To provide a neutral and all-encompassing opinion on DAOs, LDCRChas developed a [permissionless and modular framework](/prime-rating/prime-rating-squad/framework-overview) that utilizes DAO best practices and decentralized data storage to operate as independently from any centralized entity as technologically possible. By being permissionless, LDCRCis more resilient, neutral, and able to leverage the wisdom of the crowd. 

All  ratings and documents are publicly available and can be accessed non-exclusively by anyone with an internet connection, making LDCRCa public good for the benefit of the systemic advancement of digital collectives.

### Permissionless Rating 

Currently, LDCRC has two main objectives:[](#currently-prime-rating-has-two-main-objectives)

1.  Create a sound and efficient process for permissionless rating
    
2.  Create verified and high-quality reports on DAOs

Continue to the next page to dive deeper into the [LDCRC Process.](/prime-rating/prime-rating-squad/framework-overview)


### Certification Process 

==For DAOs==


### Screening  Process 

==For raters==

To submit a rating to the database, you must:

- pass the [DAOIndex-OrgForm_Tech Quiz](https://forms.gle/xphGxpdvqbCSm3p96) with a passing score of :
	- Part 1: 70%, and
	- Part 2: 60% (we will send you the link)
- have a unique ID via a unique ID service
- post on Twitter the following message: " I am a rater for the DAO Index with a score of [Percentage Score ]"

If accepted, you will receive a Membership NFT.

### Rating Process
==For raters==


The LDCRC process enables anyone to create and submit a report that will update the DAO Index, if it's accepted by governance.


#### **DAO Index from a Rater's perspective**

1.  **Decide which report you want to create:** Depending on your preference and experience you can decide whether you want to create a **Smart Contract** **Quality** or **Fundamental Analysis Report.**
    
2.  **Copy the Report template:** Download the Report templates docs or copy the G docs version below **G docs:** [Smart Contract Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w80QpVecmszAyREI9FDdHVlXwKE9EXYevPZiN9ic6sM/edit?usp=sharing) | [Fundamental Template V2.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Hb86RlpeQPiMbWTl_mi1EMURWTuE43CtOf0EWhjfvE/edit) **Word:** [Smart Contract Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/125lUAsWrO977eI1HfPmhtupwSwVmAlbz/view?usp=sharing) | [Fundamental Template V2.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sH4VDqnbCrrmPL-fdQrqdBDbDWfkPJkB/view?usp=sharing)
    
3.  **Decide** **which project** you want to create a report on. You can consult the [Prime Rating database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eIOxRAxuPawM2NkCPbGGmjZUW1xbwRZxU9kYOqsPRaA/edit?usp=sharing) to see which reports have already been created. Writing reports for **new protocols** is encouraged. However, reports of protocols already rated are also accepted, as long as the report is unique and not identified as copy&paste of a previous report
    
4.  **Fill the report:** When answering questions, try to add as many relevant references (and link to sources) to your answers to help strengthen the report. If you fill out a report for an existing project, make sure you **link to the previous reports** IPFS link at the top of the template
    
5.  **Submit the report for review:** After completion, submit the report for review in the #Report channel in the [Prime Rating Discord.](https://discord.gg/hyfc2jxnBr) Prime stewards will add their feedback. Please use Google docs, to allow for comments.
    
6.  **Submit the report for a vote:** After receiving and potentially incorporating feedback, the report can be submitted to the [Prime Rating Governance](https://app.boardroom.info/primedao/overview). The Prime Governors (Prime stewards and level-3 raters) will vote FOR/AGAINST to accept the report. As a Rater, you can submit the Report yourself using our submission form (tbd) or share the report in the #ðŸ“ƒ-submit-report channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/We7nPCvaRH) if you want a Steward to submit it for you.
    

After a proposal passes and a report gets accepted, one of the Stewards will update the [Website](https://primerating.io/) & Gitbook to reflect the new Rating state.

#### Voting Period and Governance

Prime Rating is governed by the [Prime Rating Reputation (REP) holders,](https://xdai.alchemy.do/dao/0x4ac141c4643577f8b926543e88ada35b5c8f71e6/members/) individuals, or organizations who contributed to the advancement of Prime Rating. REP is non-transferable, so only those individuals who have meaningfully contributed to Prime Rating can vote. Each vote in Prime Rating takes approximately 4 days to pass (or fail). A relative majority is needed to pass any boosted proposals.

#### 

Rewards[](#rewards)

Prime Raters are rewarded for submitting reports that are accepted by the Governance mechanisms and added to Prime Rating. Rewards are only allocated if the Report is accepted.

**Reward per unique Report:** 150 USDC + 200 PRIME

#### **Rating Guidelines**

To ensure alignment across the **vision** and **work ethic** of PrimeDAO, some important principles are outlined below. Letâ€™s begin:

1.  Be **upright** and **honest**!
    
2.  Apply **critical thinking** and be aware of your biases
    
3.  **We rate what exists today**, we do not rate what could be in the future (roadmaps are good and can flow into the scores, but what counts is what is existing today)
    
4.  **Always link your sources** (some references and sources used by PrimeRaters are listed below)
    
5.  Try to **compare** as best as you can, i.e. do not look at a protocol in isolation (this is an interactive and interconnected ecosystem)
    
6.  If possible, try to **establish contact** with the respective protocols and ask them questions
    
7.  Donâ€™t hesitate to **ask for feedback** on your reports, either via the #report-feedback channel or directly from Prime stewards and/or other raters
    
8.  Try to **avoid** too much **copy & pasting**. We encourage raters to do their own research and synthesize their thoughts over bluntly copying from the protocols website
    
9.  We encourage raters to rate projects they are **not** personally **invested** in
    
10.  **Use data**. Whenever possible use hard facts (e.g. on-chain data)
    
11.  PrimeRating is designed to be a **neutral entity**, we do not favor or disadvantage any protocols (including our partners)
12.  Disclose financial, family, employment, association  connections or interests in DAO

### Creating a Report

1. 1. Copy/Download the Report Template
2. Fill the Report Template
3. ## **Reviewing the Report**[](#reviewing-the-report)

After completing and checking the report, submit the report for review in the Prime Rating #Reports Discord channel and move on to the [submission process.](/prime-rating/prime-rating-squad/submitting-a-report)

### Submitting a Report

**First, export the report as a CSV document** and save it on your local device. It's recommended using the f**ollowing naming standard for your report "Report Type, Project, Date (YYYY-MMDD), ID (Web2/3 ID)",** for example, "DAO_OCI-d0rg-2021_1009-@twitter". The CSVversion of the Report will be uploaded and attached to your proposal.

### 2. Submitting the Report for Governance Vote[](#2-submitting-the-report-for-governance-vote)

There are **two options for submitting a Prime Rating Report** for governance vote: 1. Via Discord by a Steward or 2. Via the Alchemy DAPP on the xDAI network. The first option sacrifices some degree of trustlessness for ease of use, where the second option has a learning curve attached to it.

#### Submitting a Report via Discord[](#submitting-a-report-via-discord)

Novice Raters are recommended to submit their proposals via Discord. Simply head over to the ðŸ“ƒ-submit-report channel in the Discord and share your Report + ETH address you want to receive your rewards on.

### Rewards

Prime Raters are rewarded for submitting reports that are accepted by the Governance mechanisms and added to Prime Rating. Currently, we only reward for unique reports, reports that cover a project/category that has not been rated yet. Rewards are only allocated if the Report is accepted.

**Reward per unique Report:** 150 USDC + 200 PRIME

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Prime Rating community on Discord!
### Reviewing a Report

1. 1. Copy/Download the Review Template
2. Fill the Review Template
3. ## **Reviewing the Report**[](#reviewing-the-report)

After completing and checking the review, submit the review for review in the Prime Rating #Reports Discord channel and message the original Rater.

## DAO Index
I am trying a new version of the assessment based on the Framework that disconnects the organizing principles of DAOs from:

1. Other digital organizations, 
2. Participant experience, and
2. Performance.

This assessment specifically focuses on the organizing principles of DAOs (hereafter DAO Index).

Additionally, the assessment test this time will use a standard format for all questions, which should make self- and outsider-assessment easier. I think the use of a non-standard format and compressing multiple metrics (performance, participant experience) into one assessment made the DGov Assessment too impractical and wore me out :frowning_face:. Additionally, the assessment attempted to be too quantitative, especially considering that many of the features that we want to understand about DAOs are qualitative (and are too subjective, with one reason being the evolving evolution of the term).

I expect to assess DAOs based on a set of indicators and questions based on these 11 organizing principles:

1. Broad stakeholder participation






































2. Introducing value in relations which have been historically denied, such as labor and environment, rather than creating new financialized relations.






3. cross-border coordination







4. practicing DAO cooperativism













5. Developing cultural patterns (e.g., neologisms)












6. Information & Data Transparency















7. DAO2DAO interaction









8. Embracing social tech




9. Human-centered Algorithmic Governance





10. Community-owned Peer Production (Use-value of production held by community)



11. Supporting public goods














The questions are yes/no and allow for partial points. The points range is 0 - 100 (can normalize to 0 - 1), with:

* Yes: 100,
* Partial: 50,
* No: 0,
* N/A: 0
 
Hopefully, you guys find the assessment more useful this time. 

Currently, I am working on developing the indicators and questions. You can find the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zcapyF1aOx_DIv8JGMtxD7bMkqkN99SrJmBM8q0_pIk/edit?usp=sharing).

It is still in the early stages but I would like to get your feedback on anything and everything about the DAO Index. 

The first organization I will be evaluating is [dOrg](https://www.deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dao/0x15344ecdc2c4edfcb092e284d93c20f0529fd8a6/topLevel).

For your personal use, I recommend using the DAO's official website and docs, and DeepDAO and Govbase as data sources.

### Readings
And some helpful readings to contextualize the DAO Index's organizing principles:
