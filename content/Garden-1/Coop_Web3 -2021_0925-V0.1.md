The International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) defines a cooperative as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” [2].

The cooperative model is an ownership model that can work with various business models.

The seven cooperative principles are:

1. Voluntary and Open Membership,

2. Democratic Member Control,

3. Member Economic Participation,

4. Autonomy and Independence,

5. Education, Training, and Information,

6. Cooperation among Cooperatives, and

7. Concern for Community [2].

A cooperative is distinguished from other organizations based on democratic governance, member-ownership, and operating for the benefit of members.

### Platform Cooperatives

“Platform cooperatives are businesses that use a website, mobile app, or protocol to sell goods or services. They rely on democratic decision-making and shared ownership of the platform by workers and users” [3].

There are four types of platform cooperatives:

1.  Data,
2.  Worker,
3.  Producer, and
4.  Multi-stakeholder [5].
