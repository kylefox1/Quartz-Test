# OVERVIEW

The _**Understanding Digital Data Flows**_ training program is uniquely designed to provide individuals who play a role in developing policies for their organizations with a working understanding of the ways technology and personal data are utilized in key sectors. While these classes consider relevant laws and policies, they focus primarily on the underlying technologies, data flows, and business practices that need to be grasped in order to better understand data protection issues.

From biometrics to online advertising, participants learn directly from experts on the underlying technologies, data flows, and business practices to better understand legal, policy, and data protection issues. _**Understanding Digital Data Flows**_ classes are presented by FPF staff and carefully selected invited technical experts.

FPF works with senior privacy executives of leading companies and with academics, civil society, and policymakers to advance principled data practices in support of emerging technologies. To learn more about FPF and its experts, please visit [**https://fpf.org/about/**](https://fpf.org/about/).

## Session format
All sessions will take place live and in a virtual setting through 2021 and early 2022. Each will be hosted by knowledgeable FPF experts and carefully selected invited technical experts to provide real-world insights. Sessions are intended to be interactive and registered participants will have an opportunity to ask questions of hosts and to learn from each other.

## Cancellation Policy

Cancellations will be honored, minus vendor processing fees, up until 3 days before the scheduled session. For cancellations after that date, we will honor the registration for the next scheduled date of the class or another of the _Understanding Digital Data Flows_ training classes at FPF discretion.

Hmm, will call the training program *Understanding the Ledgerback Frontier*. 

Also need to make a [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZzRywd91XnLk-pzqcLpj9fiy65awjomognw1iLNzNNs/edit?usp=sharing) `here` for [*topics and schedule*](https://fpf.org/training/), and route people to our Eventbrite. 

Also offer Session passes (i.e., bundles).

And they even keep the description of the training short:

```markdown

[Going beyond the fundamentals of online advertising, this session provides an in-depth examination of the online advertising ecosystem focusing on a variety of topics, including mobile platforms, consent frameworks, analytics, and the technologies behind them. We will also explore the challenges affecting the future of online advertising, including deprecation of third-party cookies, platform requirements related to tracking, and key laws and regulations shaping the ad tech sector, as well as technologies developed to address user and legal requirements globally.](https://fpf.org/uddf-topic/beyond-the-basics-of-online-advertising/)

# OVERVIEW

The ***Understanding the Ledgerback Frontier*** training program is  uniquely designed to provide indidivudals who are interested in (or *self-study*) researching and educatting others on the Decentralized Web (DWeb) and related fields (i.e., the Ledgerback Frontier) a working understanding of how to study the Ledgerback Frontier. While these classes consider relevant tools and foundational knowledge, they focus primarily on the underlying technologies, governance structures and business practices that need to be grasped in order to better understand Ledgerback Frontier `social, technical, and socio-technical` issues, formulate questions to traverse the information/idea space, and create new visions of the future.

From Web3 to Platform Cooperativism to Tools for Thought (TfT), participants learn directly from experts on the underlying technologies, governance structures and business practices to better understand sociotechnical ~~legal, policy, and data protection~~ issues. _**Understanding the Ledgerback Frontier**_ classes are presented by LDCRC expert-members and carefully selected invited technical experts (can also be governance, business, ethical, legal, etc.).

~~LDCRC works with senior privacy executives of leading companies and with academics, civil society, and policymakers to advance principled data practices in support of emerging technologies.

# Sessions
## Basics of Web3 `only one that needs editing (maybe only talk about blockchain?)`
Web3 is the next stage of the web after Web2, with an emphasis on _correcting_ for the infrastructural, economic and social issues in Web2 that led to the rise of Big Tech’s (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple) walled gardens and extractive business models through peer-to-peer (p2p) networks, cryptography, open protocols, and new business models.

Web3 is the next stage of the web after Web2, with an emphasis on _correcting_ for the infrastructural, economic and social issues in Web2 that led to the rise of Big Tech’s (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple) walled gardens and extractive business models by re-architecting the web and the internet through peer-to-peer (p2p) networks, cryptography, open protocols, and other emerging technologies.

The _Fundamentals of Web3_ session will cover a short overview of decentralization, p2p networks, digital identity, Web

The _Basics of Web3_ session will cover the infrastructural, economic and social issues in Web2 and how Web3 plans to correct them. More specifically, this session will cover an overview of decentralization, p2p network models, blockchain history, benefits and decision model, value accounting, blockchain thinking, data silos, digital infrastructure, digital identity, and rentier capitalism (**iget this down to about 5 items**)

The _Basics of Web3_ session will cover the infrastructural, economic and social issues in Web2 and how Web3 plans to correct them. More specifically, this session will cover an overview of value accounting, decentralization, digital identity, data silos (i.e., walled gardens), open protocols, blockchain basics, overview of p2p network models, digital infrastructure issues, rentier capitalism, blockchain thinking, and the cypherpunk movement.

If jsut focusing on re-architecting our digital infrastructure, then decentralization, basic public key cryptography, open protocols, blockchain basics, p2p networks

This session will last about 2 to 3 hours. 

## Basics of Platform Cooperativism

Platform cooperativism refers to a global movement to apply cooperative principles to the web, provide better working conditions for digital laborers, and challenge the current platform ecosystem paradigm. A specific institutional form, the Platform Cooperative, is the poster child of this movement. A platform cooperative is a cooperative that offers a good or service via a website, mobile app, or protocol (or any digital means). The _Basics of Platform Cooperativism_ session will cover platform ecosystems with a focus on platform governance, cooperatives as an institutional form, extractive business models, and a short overview of platform cooperatives and digital labor issues. This session will last about 1 hour.

## Basics of Research on the Decentralized Web (DWeb)
The Decentralized Web (DWeb) is an exciting and emerging space. There is so much information coming out of the DWeb that searching and evaluating information is a problem in and of itself that inhibits formulating impactful questions, leads to running into dead-ends, or accidently re-inventing the wheel.

In the _Basics of Research on the Decentralized Web_ session, we will explore how to filter through information in the DWeb and formulate impactful questions for your own research or product development. We will primarily work through a case study for the session.

This session will last about 1 hour.

## Blockchain Cooperatives: The intersection of Cooperativism and Web3

Web3 and Cooperativism are two movements that seem separate or disconnected from a bird’s-eye view, but once we look closer, we see that Web3 and Cooperativism share many similarities (especially with digital flavors of cooperativism such as platform cooperativism) and intersect at the economic and social layers of the DWeb, and offer an interesting design space upon which both can learn and improve upon the other. The intersection of Web3 and Cooperatives, which we call Blockchain Cooperatives or Web3 Cooperatives, offers an interesting design space where we can take designs emerging from both spaces and bring them together to create new combinations that can address issues in Web3, Cooperatives, or both. The _Blockchain Cooperatives: The intersection of Cooperativism and Web3_ session will go over how Web3 and Cooperativism are connected, reasons to explore this design space, and a short overview of organizations that integrate Cooperativism and Web3 (i.e., existing blockchain cooperatives).
