# Courses

I am currently trying to finish making course materials for 2 courses:

1. Introduction to Platform Cooperativism
2. Decentralized and Open Thinking


## Introduction to Platform Cooperativism
### Part 2
Part 2 will focus on the drivers of platform cooperativism.

This is my outline so far for Part 2, based on these Drivers (the catalysts for the platform cooperativism movement):
    

1.  Digital Labor (Microwork)
    
2.  Social Contracts
    
3.  Monopoly power
    
4.  Platform regulation
    
5.  Historic practices (piecemeal work)
    
6.  Data sharing and markets
    
7.  Need for decentralized web? 
	1.  Data silos?
	2.   Web2 infrastructure problems (compared withÂ  Web3?) 
		1.  Like AWS and lack of interoperability
    
8.  [Surveillance capitalism](https://thereboot.com/how-surveillance-advertising-seized-our-data-and-hijacked-the-web/) -> Data Protection laws
    
9.  Sharing economy or Platform Capitalism
    
10.  Unions losing power?
    
11.  Occupy Wallstreet
    
12.  Creator Economy
    
13.  Current Platform Business Models
	1.  Extractive models
	2.  Venture Capitalists/Silicon Valley
    

Some of these sections will get combined with others.



I am also changing the format for each section to:



-   Materials
-   Notes
-   Quiz
-   Hypothetical
-   More Resources
-   Review
    


This gives me a little less work and should connect the learner with actors and content that are more informative than just the slides.

I am also looking into how to turn the course into a game with [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) or [Defold](https://defold.com/).
