# Bikestream: Databikes for a user-centric mobility future

`This article is an intro to the Bikestream project`

I am putting my thoughts down to come up with a whitepaper for Bikestream.

As always, send your feedback to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CAdjovu) account.

-   why alts
-   Describe bikestream benefit for individuals
-   Examples (include purpose and individual benefits)

### Outline — 2021–08–11

-   Purpose
-   Background on coops, mention platform coop (grab from research cooperative article)
-   why alts
-   Describe bikestream benefit for individuals
-   Example implementations (crowdsourced bikesharing, bike delivery, self-driving e-bikes)
-   describe mobility cooperatives

### Purpose

To develop a product- and collective-model to support the cooperative sharing of mobility, personal and sensor data from micro-mobility vehicles (or light electric vehicles), and express autonomy over one’s own micro-mobility vehicle’s hardware and software.

Bikestream will develop Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) to be managed by personal data cooperatives.

### Background

#### Cooperatives

The International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) defines a cooperative as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” [2].

The cooperative model is an ownership model that can work with various business models.

The seven cooperative principles are:

1. Voluntary and Open Membership,

2. Democratic Member Control,

3. Member Economic Participation,

4. Autonomy and Independence,

5. Education, Training, and Information,

6. Cooperation among Cooperatives, and

7. Concern for Community [2].

A cooperative is distinguished from other organizations based on democratic governance, member-ownership, and operating for the benefit of members.

#### Platform Cooperatives

“Platform cooperatives are businesses that use a website, mobile app, or protocol to sell goods or services. They rely on democratic decision-making and shared ownership of the platform by workers and users” [3].

There are four types of platform cooperatives:

1.  Data,
2.  Worker,
3.  Producer, and
4.  Multi-stakeholder [5].

### Why the need for Bikestream as an alternative?

check the slides

Bikestream serves as an alternative to …

Problems Bikestream is intended to address include:

-   Transportation network companies (TNCs) sharing user-generated data with third-parties that users may or may not be aware of (e.g., TNCs may share user-generated data with law enforcement and transportation agencies and the extent or necessity of the amount of data is always in question).
-   TNCs prohibiting disclosure (or lack of transparency) of their algorithms (development, usage, etc.) and software to users of their platforms (i.e., use of closed-source software)
-   TNCs using user-generated data to train machine learning models for proprietary use and monetary gain (e.g., sharing data with advertisers) at the expense of users
-   Fitness and health tracking apps sharing user-generated data with third parties that users may or may not be aware of and data privacy concerns such as securing of user data and preventing data breaches ( (e.g., Tracking apps may share user-generated data with law enforcement and transportation agencies and the extent or necessity of the amount of data is always in question).
-   New mobility data specifications are targeted towards TNCs (and rightfully so), but there should be a need to develop a specification specifically for users to offer this data to their local transportation agencies themselves
-   The high cost of pre-assembled e-bikes [(“… e-bikes sell for more than four times the price of traditional bicycles…”)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/674381/size-global-market-electric-bicycles/) make them not the most viable option for most middle to low income people to purchase when considering a bicycle as a means of transportation.
-   Many people have a bicycle that is not be used to its full potential (i.e., wasting resources) often because of their urban living space (E.g., suburbs with little to no bike lanes, cities with mass sprawl, tough road conditions)
-   Lack of PoCs concerning blockchain and mobility
-   Lack of education among users about how their data is used and concerning MaaS companies
-   Lack of education or opportunities for cyclists to contribute to transportation research
-   Lack of education among professional bicycle operators about cooperative models
-   [Issues with modifying pre-assembled e-bikes can make it tough for users to find maintenance or services or change parts on their own (i.e., removal of right to improve)](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/pages/warranty)
-   [Lack of uniformity on regulations (local and beyond) on micromobility modals.](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/inrix-updates-road-rules-platform-to-fit-evolving-dialogue-around-data/558356/)
-   High rate of pedestrian and cyclists deaths in the USA.2
-   Control of geolocation mapping by very few companies which are often not known for good data privacy practices (e.g., Google)
-   [TNCs (primarily Uber and Lyft) tend not to play well with public transportation and other TNCs, which often lead to a lack of transparency around payments, mobility options, and inhibition of user choice.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/what-s-behind-lyft-s-battle-over-bikeshare-access)

  

### Individual benefits from bikestream

Bikestream is expected to provide the following benefits to individuals:

-   a protected datastore for member’s personal or business data
-   choice/control over the terms upon which (how, when, and for what purposes) personal mobility and sensor data is shared with third parties
-   remuneration for data sharing and being a host on Streamr network
-   say in decision-making in cooperative with equal voting power, acess to records, and ability to elect or recall board of directors
-   individual gain from using a product developed based on the collective’s data aggregation or being used to develop new insights into a problem
-   social gains as data aggregation can also be used to help non-members
-   alternative to surveillance capitalism
-   control over the hardware and software used in their micro-mobility vehicles by using mostly open-source software and plug-and-play parts
-   members can build their own micro-mobility vehicles by using mostly open-source software and plug-and-play parts
-   discounted pricing on purchasing electric conversion parts and repairing micro-mobility devices
-   insurance for micro-mobility devices
-   token-gated access to a global fleet of micro-mobility vehicles

### Example implementations 

We expect Bikestream to be implemented in multiple use-cases, including:

-   decentralized/crowdsourced bikesharing systems, 
-   bike delivery service, 
-   self-driving e-bikes,
-   data unions (i.e., data cooperatives and data commons),
-   geolocation mapping,
-   e-bike education,
-   citizen science projects including measuring vibration on cycling surfaces
-   Providing a variety of bicycle related services

### For Gavin (read below)

### What is Bikestream?

A research project on how to converge (connect annd integrate) Web 3 and Platform Cooperativism via micro-mobility modals.

A research project on using emerging tech and democratic ownership models to support data and vehicle sovereignty of micro-mobility modals.

A research project on using social technology and democratic ownership models to support data and vehicle sovereignty of micro-mobility modals.

A research project on using social technology and democratic ownership models to support data and vehicle sovereignty of micro-mobility modals as we move towards Industry 4.0.

A research project on using emerging and social technology and democratic ownership models to support data and vehicle sovereignty of micro-mobility modals as we move towards Industry 4.0.

### What is Bikestream’s purpose/ How will work be done?

We are developing product- and collective-models to support the cooperative sharing of mobility, personal, vehicle, and sensor data from micro-mobility vehicles (or light electric vehicles). Specifically, we use electric bicycles.

Notably, we execute on our ideas by building proof-of-concepts (PoCs).

We will be developing a knowledge/data commons on information relevant to the project (such as cycling-related markets and Web3 mobility companies), and a newsletter to help people keep up with Bikestream.

 Additionally, we will see if we can operate a data marketplace and provide data storage, visualization and analysis tools.

Should publish Bikestream Data Cooperative (& Federation through frannchising) model with a post. And a Bikestream DAO model.
