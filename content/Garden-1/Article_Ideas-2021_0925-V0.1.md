# Articles

Here are some article drafts and ideas I have been working on for the past 2 months.

They cover many areas so drafting has been a bit harder than I would like (T_T).

Hopefully, I can get some of these out by the end of October. I will probably start with the GTC and Data Commons articles.

Alternatively, I might turn these into podcasts.
