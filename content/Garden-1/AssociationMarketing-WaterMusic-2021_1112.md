Just started looking at [Water & Music](https://www.waterandmusic.com/membership/) and feel that they are similar to the Association.

# Call to Action
> “By becoming a member, you'll support cutting-edge research on emerging technologies and business models in the music industry, and get access to a private, like-minded community of artists, marketers, dealmakers and entrepreneurs.”

Nice call to action (CTA) to be a member. 

My take for the Association:

By becoming a member, you will support cutting-edge research on emerging technologies, business models, and organizational models in the Ledgerback Frontier, and get access to a private, like-minded community of scholars, philanthropists, technologies, social entrepeneurs, and more. 

> Join our membership and instantly unlock access to exclusive articles and independent research

# Membership Benefits

> Private Discord server: In our members-only Discord server, like-minded industry professionals gather daily to discuss the latest music-tech news and trends — and the occasional off-the-cuff music memes — in a focused, off-the-record environment.

> Exclusive articles: Every month, we publish several exclusive, long-form breakdowns of music and technology trends — featuring original market maps, frameworks and data analyses around music-industry innovation and change that you won't find elsewhere.

> Company databases: Members get access not only to our insights, but also to our research process behind the scenes, in the form of regularly updated, highly curated databases of startups and deals defining the music/tech landscape today.

I think the Association will also offer similar benefits. The *company databases* is similar to the Observatory project, the exclusive articles is simlar to the Ledgerback Hub, and the Private Discord Server is similar to the private Element server. 

I think the additional benefits we give are governance rights (though this might change with their $Stream tokens) and specific benefits (based on NC2I and Multistakeholder membership update) for each membership class (and classes beyond Water & Music's consumer class). I think for the Association to grow, and most imprtonatly to challenge in a 4+ sided market that is a research institute (donors/philanthropists, beneficiaries (generally, people in the public), customers, experts), the infrastrucure must be in place to attract experts because I feel experts are the lynchpin in this market.

Though, this memberhsip offering has helped me think of how to target consumers, especially with a monthly subscription and an annual subscription plan. Maybe I will just go with this depending on if any software allows for it. Additionally, that I might be interested in offering *too many benefits* to members, which could be unsustainable in the long run. 


The pricing seems hefty but is probably worth it ($20/month -> $200/year). I would rather charge for each individual project and then also charge for the additional services that come with membership for each class. Additionally, I would still prefer for their to be some public benefit to go along with the work being done at the Association (especially because the Assocaition is a 501(c)(3)). This is why I intend to make the basic fields for each table in the Obsevratory project free to the public, while charging for access to the advanced fields (free for members) through an API or paywall (i.e., a Freemium model), and similar with the Ledgerback Hub which will have articles that have a *public* and *members-only* section (I am thinking introductions, abstracts and outlines should be public for members-only articles). Additionally, this is why I intend to make multiple tiers for products as well.
