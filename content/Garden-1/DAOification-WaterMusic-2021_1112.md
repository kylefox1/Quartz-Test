## [$STREAM and collaborative research “seasons”](https://waterandmusic.mirror.xyz/ox_BFXwgue_sJjP9J8IQcN-Q7Po-S1RWugM-Nwr4z6Y)

Water & Music’s Web3 strategy will span both fungible and non-fungible tokens.

The main pillar of our framework will be **$STREAM, a “research token” that represents high-quality, tangible contributions to our larger project of collaborative research, knowledge-sharing and community-building in music and tech**.

At the outset, the $STREAM token will have no inherent financial value. Rather, the token will function primarily as **on-chain credit** for contributions across our Discord server, editorial and research verticals, in-person events and more. Over time, token earnings and ownership will carve a path to governance for our most active contributors, who will have a say in the future of our collective research agendas and of the Water & Music DAO as a whole.

We are currently **piloting Season 1 of a new collaborative research format**, in which we work together with members of our community to assemble the definitive, foundational syllabus on a particular trend in music and tech. In a somewhat meta turn of events, **Season 1’s theme is about the current state of music and crypto**. We currently have over 30 of our members opted in to collaborate on research across multiple different working groups including music/web3 tooling, NFT royalties and contracts, generative music NFTs, fan sentiment analysis and fan onboarding case studies, covering tasks and skills including interviewing, writing and data analysis/visualization.

**All contributors to Season 1 of our collaborative research will receive a launch airdrop of $STREAM in early December**, which is when we plan on publishing the results of our work.

Given our existing community history and growth journey leading up to this point, we will also send a $STREAM airdrop in December to the following people:

-   **Writers and researchers** — people who contributed guest articles to Water & Music in the past, and/or are helping us put together our collaborative reports today.
-   **Moderators and discussion leaders** — members who have led high-quality discussions about the music industry and guided/onboarded new members in our Discord server.
-   **Longtime supporters** — members who have supported Water & Music financially from its early days (including on our old Patreon page).
-   **Current and former team members of Water & Music** — people who have helped guide the higher-level strategy of the organization as a whole.

In the near future, we also plan on dropping **limited-edition NFTs (using tools like [Mirror’s Editions](https://dev.mirror.xyz/AOoIsKPfZvf8LACKWp7gj_mg1ICCDOfPnVBOsDQoXo8)) around the debut of each season**, which will allow a wider range of outside stakeholders to be recognized on-chain as supporters of Water & Music’s mission. Funds from these NFT sales will be distributed among core contributors to our research and community projects.

We are still in the process of designing this framework, and would love to hear any feedback you might have on these initial concepts at [hi@waterandmusic.com](http://mailto:hi@waterandmusic.com/) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/home).

I really like this idea for the $STREAM token. 

I was having similar thoughts for the Ledgerback Frontier Portal and for the Volunter Board.
