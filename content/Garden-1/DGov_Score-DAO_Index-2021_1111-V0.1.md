## Certification Mark
I think [this](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEvfcMWFOo/3b2UswD49JVGoMVw_kwTCQ/view?utm_content=DAEvfcMWFOo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) is a pretty good preliminary design for a certification mark for the DAO Index. 

Take a look here:

## Survey

The Survey is up to Version 0.6!

I completed my first analysis under Version 0.5 and 0.6 on [dOrg](dorg.tech) and even had an interview with a dOrg member to go over the survey. 

You can find the survey and my analysis of dOrg [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oFhEG9nnHcBv0YVT5fR-wmdFNWZ-GllhVUmq3re4ISU/edit?usp=sharing). `Mind you, the spreadsheets are super messy right now.`

The survey was (luckily) well received and I shall continue to analyze DAOs as I continue to improve the survey. 

The DAOs I think I will analyze next are:

1.  Raid Guild 
    
2.  MetaCartel
    
3.  Sevens Foundation?
    
4.  Seed Club or FWB
    
5.  Rekt or Forefront
    
6.  Index Coop
    
7.  Colony
    
## Expertise NfX
Can the DAO Index help the Association get [Expertise Network Effects (NfX)](https://www.nfx.com/post/14th-network-effect-expertise/) ?

## Open Rating System and Database

I am also thinking about how to turn the DAO Index into an open rating system where anyone, if they can pass a basic test, can be allowed to add and review ratings of DAOs in the Ass'n's DAO Index database. 

I was looking at PrimeDAO's [Prime Rating system ](https://primedao.gitbook.io/prime-rating/) and I found it to be extremely informative for making such a system. I will be looking at this further after I complete more analyses under the survey or the survey reaches Version 1.0.
