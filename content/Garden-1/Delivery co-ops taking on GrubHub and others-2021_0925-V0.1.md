The International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) defines a cooperative as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” [2].

The cooperative model is an ownership model that can work with various business models.

The seven cooperative principles are:

1. Voluntary and Open Membership,

2. Democratic Member Control,

3. Member Economic Participation,

4. Autonomy and Independence,

5. Education, Training, and Information,

6. Cooperation among Cooperatives, and

7. Concern for Community [2].

A cooperative is distinguished from other organizations based on democratic governance, member-ownership, and operating for the benefit of members.

### Platform Cooperatives

“Platform cooperatives are businesses that use a website, mobile app, or protocol to sell goods or services. They rely on democratic decision-making and shared ownership of the platform by workers and users” [3].

There are four types of platform cooperatives:

1.  Data,
2.  Worker,
3.  Producer, and
4.  Multi-stakeholder [5].

### Delivery Cooperatives

A delivery cooperative is a cooperative that provides delivery services or products to members (consumers; e.g., restaurants) or non-members (producers; usually couriers).

A delivery cooperative can be a platform cooperative if they use a website or app to provide their services [2].

### Why alternatives?

  

Delivery cooperatives have risen in response to the pervasive online surveillance by Big Tech companies (i.e., surveillance capitalism),the inability to reign in companies that sell user data conspicuously and lack of care in shoring up cybersecurity measures, and companies developing AI/ML tools to be used in real-world affairs that lack transparency and accountability over their development and use[ youre data article].

Delivery coops have risen in response to (list reasons below):

-   “Delivery drivers — who are considered independent contractors — often earn low wages for minimal protections from the companies.”[1]
-   commission fee structures lead to ~~couriers and~~ businesses (e.g., restaurants) earning low wages with platform owners claiming large fees(e.g., 30%)[1]
-   bad practices by platform owners including “Grubhub building [fake restaurant websites](https://www.eater.com/2020/1/29/21113416/grubhub-seamless-kin-khao-online-delivery-mistake-doordash), or DoorDash [delivering knockoff food](https://www.eater.com/2020/1/29/21113416/grubhub-seamless-kin-khao-online-delivery-mistake-doordash) from ghost kitchens.”[1]
-   couriers cannot access customer data and own courier data, lack of tansparency over how algorithms employed on platform work[1]

### Delivery Cooperative Individual Benefits

Edu cooperatives provide the following benefits to individuals:

-   lower fees to restaurants and fees
-   more consistent revenue for couriers

Examples

### Issues

> But the convenience of these apps masks an inherently predatory nature, with crippling fees and dubious business practices that afflict restaurants and delivery drivers. Commission fees can account for about 15 to 30 percent of an order’s sales, and major companies including Grubhub have been [sued for alleged sneaky practices to ramp up fees](https://www.eater.com/2019/5/29/18636255/delivery-apps-hurting-restaurants-grubhub-seamless-ubereats). Delivery drivers — who are considered independent contractors — often earn low wages for minimal protections from the companies. Reports have revealed creatively devised schemes, like Grubhub building [fake restaurant websites](https://www.eater.com/2020/1/29/21113416/grubhub-seamless-kin-khao-online-delivery-mistake-doordash), or DoorDash [delivering knockoff food](https://www.eater.com/2020/1/29/21113416/grubhub-seamless-kin-khao-online-delivery-mistake-doordash) from ghost kitchens.

> Representatives for the top three delivery apps — DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub — all defended their commission fee structures. In statements, they asserted that those funds cover platform operating fees and fair wages for drivers. Meanwhile, [reports have revealed](https://www.salon.com/2020/01/19/doordash-drivers-make-an-average-of-145-an-hour-analysis-finds/) how most DoorDash contract workers actually earn less than $2 per order, after expenses.

> is one of many alternatives to larger third-party delivery companies that have been ramped up and expanded in the face of 30% commission rates and inaccessibility to customer data
