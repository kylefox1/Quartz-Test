### Why cooperatives for data pooling and sharing

[**How Surveillance Advertising Seized Our Data and Hijacked the Web - The Reboot**  
_As internet and mobile platforms have grown to become the world's most important advertising media, the public has come…_thereboot.com](https://thereboot.com/how-surveillance-advertising-seized-our-data-and-hijacked-the-web/ "https://thereboot.com/how-surveillance-advertising-seized-our-data-and-hijacked-the-web/")[](https://thereboot.com/how-surveillance-advertising-seized-our-data-and-hijacked-the-web/)

In _How Surveillance Advertising Seized Our Data and Hijacked the Web_, Matthew Crain discusses the issues with the online advertising business model that defines surveillance capitalism.

Surveillance capitalism is the use of this online advertising business model and ensuring that the value that is generated by the collectionnn and aggregation of user/visitor-produced data remains in the hands of a few companies or that the value generated is not distributed back to the users/visitors who produced the data.

Theonline advertising business model, with the biggest players beig Google and Facebook, directs advertsing technnology compaies to seek out, and collect and aggregate data on users/visitors to their website, both when they are on the site and off the site (third-party tracking ), store the data on their servers, and then sell the data to marketers to conduct personalized advertising (advertising targeting a particular individual). This model is present throughout the web, and even companis you would nnot generally associate with onlinne advertising, such as Mastercard (a payment network), are also employing this model [ youre data article]. 

even if the site a users/visitor does not employ the model, the third parties the website exchanges data with may do so, or the third parties they choose to associate with, and so on and so forth.

However, it is not just a couple companies associated with

> “A study of one million popular websites found that nearly [90 percent](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/3646) of them exchange data with third parties behind the scenes. Various methods of linking online and offline personal information have severely undermined the notion of privacy.”

> The problem is that while many people know that surveillance occurs online, [few understand the complexities](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/) and pitfalls of omnipresent behavioral tracking. In fact, given the scale at which consumer data markets operate, making informed decisions about one’s personal data is effectively [impossible](https://cyber.jotwell.com/good-fences-make-better-data-brokers/). This is because data are routinely combined and repackaged for all manner of downstream uses divorced from the original context of collection. How can someone evaluate the data practices of a social media company without knowing if their information might be used in the future to [evaluate their creditworthiness](https://www.wsj.com/articles/borrowers-hit-socialmedia-hurdles-1389224469)? Privacy choices made in this context are neither clear nor meaningful.

> Behind the theater curtain, it’s an open secret among advertising practitioners that if consumers were truly empowered to make meaningful privacy choices, the surveillance advertising business model would implode. [Survey](https://review.content-science.com/the-false-tradeoff-between-customer-experience-and-customer-privacy/) after [survey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2019/08/15/people-are-becoming-more-reluctant-to-share-personal-data-survey-reveals/#6c84bbf71ed1) after [survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/) confirms that consumers by and large do not trust companies to be good stewards of their data and would rather have more, not less, privacy online.

### Governance Models

There are new data stewardship models arising in response to Big Tech’s surveillance capitalism practices. According to/ In _What Does it Mean? | Shifting Power Through Data Governance,_ Mozilla Insights, Jonathan van Geuns and Ana Brandusescu discuss seven alternative data governance approaches [1]. The seven approaches are:

1.  data cooperatives,
2.  data commons,
3.  data trusts,
4.  data fiduciaries,
5.  data marketplaces,
6.  data collaboratives, and
7.  indigenous data sovereignty [1].

This article will cover data cooperatives and ?AI commons (an example of a knowledge commons)?.

A data cooperative is “a legal construct to facilitate the collaborative pooling of data by individuals or organizations for the economic, social, or cultural benefit of the group” [1].

A data commons is a collective where “data is pooled and shared as a common resource” [1].

A data cooperative is a type of platform cooperative [2].

“Platform cooperatives are businesses that use a website, mobile app, or protocol to sell goods or services. They rely on democratic decision-making and shared ownership of the platform by workers and users” [3].

There are four types of platform cooperatives:

1.  Data,
2.  Worker,
3.  Producer, and
4.  Multi-stakeholder [5].

An artificial intelligence (AI) commons is …

An artificial intelligence (AI) commons is a collective of researchers or data subjects that pool and share their knowledge, expertise, tools and data to develop and govern AI/ML models.

> I developed this **AI commons** definition to be **analogous** to a **data commons**

A data marketplace is “an approach that enables consumers to sell or trade their personal data for services or other benefits” [1].

AI commons provides models for data coops and marketplaces?

> Think of a data cooperative as a data commons combined with an enterprise. 

#### How Alternatives Can Interact

In my opinion, I think an AI commons, data cooperative and data marketplaces can all work together. For example, an AI commons can provide models for data cooperatives to use in their data analysis for member benefit and offered as a service in a data marketplace.

Additionally, a data cooperative can make it easier for an individual to transact in a data marketplace as a data supplier or curator.

### Why alternatives?

Data cooperatives, data commons, and AI commons (all together alternatives) have risen in response to the pervasive online surveillance by Big Tech companies (i.e., surveillance capitalism),the inability to reign in companies that sell user data conspicuously and lack of care in shoring up cybersecurity measures, and companies developing AI/ML tools to be used in real-world affairs that lack transparency and accountability over their development and use[ youre data article].

AI commons is also to counter “[t]he stranglehold tech giants have on [AI because]” “the resources necessary to create the best-performing AI and NLP models are found mainly at technology giants,” and new AI models “are [often] private and only restricted access — or no access at all — is provided to many academic organizations, making it impossible to answer important questions around these models and study capabilities, limitations, potential improvements, bias, and fairness” [7]. Furthermore, an AI commons as a counter to Big Tech is needed because AI “will have a fundamental impact on society, as these technologies are at the core of the tools many of us use on a daily basis” [7].

Data cooperatives, data commons, and AI commons (all together alternatives) have risen in response to (list reasons below):

- Describe platform coop (grab from research cooperative article)  
- Describe an edu coop and benefit for individuals

### Data Cooperative Models (how to structure data coop) and Individual Benefits

“which aim to customize protected data stores for their members while generating a non-profit social value from doing so — share the same underlying goals: collective ownership, decentralized self-governance, transparency, and the offering of an alternative to platform capitalism”

Data cooperatives provide the following benefits to individuals:

-   a protected datastore for member’s personal or business data
-   choice/control over the terms upon which (how, when, and what purposes) data is shared with third parties
-   remuneration for data sharing
-   say in decision-making in cooperative with equal voting power, acess to records, and ability to elect or recall board of directors
-   individual gain from using a product developed based on the collective’s data aggregation or being used to develop new insights into a problem
-   social gains as data aggregation can also be used to help non-members
-   alternative to surveillance capitalism

data cooperatives can come in a variety of models depending on the membership’s goals. examples include:

-   for-profit (data sharing
-   non-profit

Generally

### Industry presence (e.g., savvy in healthcare)

### Tech

Technologies have been developed in the past decade to ensure data privacy for data subjects. Some of these privacy-preserving technologies include:

-   Personal Data Stores
-   Blockchain and smart contracts for data tokenization (Ocean, Streamr)
-   Zero-knowledge proofs?
-   Decentralized Identity solutions?

### ML value-chain

The alternatives can exist in X stages of the ML value-chain.

As described by [Arne Wolfewicz](https://levity.ai/authors/arne-wolfewicz) in _The value chain of machine learning_, the ML value-chain consists of “six major steps”:

1.  “Problem definition,
2.  Data collection,
3.  Data storage,
4.  Data preparation,
5.  Algorithm programming, and
6.  Application development” [5].

Problem definition is defining the problem, determining the objectives to be met and milestones along the way [5]. 

Data collection is “about gathering the raw data” [5].

Data storage is “ the process of compiling raw data in data centers” [5].

Data preparation is “It describes all efforts that make data utilizable for the ML algorithms. This could include data conversion, cleaning, enhancement, formatting, and labeling” [5].

Algorithm programming is developing the algorithm (i.e., ML cod) and training the algorithm on the data [5].

“Application development is the process of turning the ML model into a commercially viable product. The code comes to life. In this step, software engineers and business people work hand in hand. Great raw data and high-quality code are worth nothing if there isn’t a use case for it” [5].

The players in the ML value-chain are described below [5].

Players from ML value-chain [5].

^**need to define steps**

Data cooperatives are best for stages 1 - 3, and 6.

AI commons are best for stages 4-6.

Data marketplaces are best for stages 2 - 4.

Together, the alternatives can show a new path to developing ML models that benefits data subjects and society through increased transparency and accountability.

For example, Brave Coop (tech coop) can use Eleuther AI’s GPT-NEO to develop chatbots for _????_

### Posmo

-   purpose
-   benefit

### What is Posmo?

Posmo (POSitive MObility) is a mobility data platform. Using machine learning, Posmo can understand how people move.

### Wozu Posmo?

If we understand mobility better and make it more transparent for everyone, we can influence one of the most important drivers of climate change. However, data on individual mobility behavior are currently in the hands of a few private actors who do not share this data with the public.

### Posmo.coop — a data cooperative

The Posmo Switzerland cooperative acts as the trustee of the data collected via the Posmo One (and Posmo B app). Members of the cooperative decide on the transfer of their data to third parties. The aim is to have broad cooperative membership among the users of the Posmo One app.

### How does Posmo work?

The Posmo One App collects GPS and other sensor data via the Posmo One Mobile App. It automatically interprets the user’s form of mobility and route segments in real time with the help of machine learning. The collected data can be used as a basis for decision-making in shaping more sustainable mobility. The users of the apps have full control over their data at all times.

### Why should I become a member of the cooperative?

Our mobility data provide information about our lives. Nobody should be able to benefit from it without our control. As a member of the cooperative, you determine how your data will be used and to whom it should be made available in a positive sense (e.g. for climate-neutral urban planning). [6]

###   

### Polypoly

“Polypoly is trying to take a more comprehensive approach in order to attract users and enterprises. The goal is to make respecting privacy a cheaper and more economically effective option for companies, one that outweighs the economic drive to hoover up as much data as possible and lock it away from consumers. To do that, Polypoly has created three structures: [a foundation](https://polypoly.org/en-gb/foundation), [a data cooperative](https://polypoly.coop/en-de/membership), and a [for-profit company](https://polypoly.com/en-gb/ecosystem).

These three pillars are designed to offer a new data deal. Enterprises can harness the unused computing power on edge devices as a way to lower the capital costs involved in constantly expanding and maintaining data centers. On the other side, users would effectively rent their computing power while also keeping all of their personal data locally on their devices.

At the core of this system is a technology called the polyPod, an application that creates a decentralized network for computing. Consumers can download it as an app that runs on their devices, including laptops, smartphones, tablets, and connected devices. Dittmar said polyPod will take advantage of advances in [edge computing](https://venturebeat.com/?s=edge+computing) and the rollout of [5G networks.](https://venturebeat.com/?s=5g)

“All of us have an iPhone or something similar that is basically a small supercomputer,” Dittmar said. “These supercomputers are made in a way that it is able to handle peaks. So if you want to unlock your phone with your face, that really needs some computation. But that happens very rarely. So on average, you’re using 4% of the computing power. If we are able to use 1% of the computing power of devices across the world, that would be more computing power than Google has.”

Via the polyPod, users grant permission to other applications and the processing of such data remains local on the phone. This means the company behind the app doesn’t get to add that data to a centralized server. Dittmar believes those companies will see big savings on computing infrastructure, part of which would be passed on to the polyPod end user. Keeping the data local and on devices also offers another potential cost saving in terms of avoiding many data compliance rules.

The technology underlying the polyPod is owned and managed under the cooperative structure. Anyone can use the application for free and potentially be eligible for some compensation. But they can also buy shares in the co-op to become a member, starting at €5 for one share up to €500 for 100 shares.

Each member gets one vote in any policy decisions, but more shares make them eligible for more profit-sharing at the end of each year. The co-op manages relationships with enterprises, which pay in a small portion of their savings on capital costs. Dittmar estimates this could result in profit-sharing that nets the average polyPod user as much as $250 per month.

Each country needs to have its own cooperative structure, ensuring that the data structure conforms to any local laws. This is where the foundation comes in. The foundation will offer guidelines and best practices for setting up co-ops in each country, Dittmar said.

As for the for-profit part, Polypoly will offer services to help companies adapt their enterprise IT structures and leverage the distributed computing network, as well as conceiving of other possible services using this alternative computing architecture.

Aside from the monetary incentives, Dittmar is banking on the appeal of other intangible benefits. For consumers, there’s the satisfaction of knowing that their data remains under their control. They can also continue to monitor it closely and ensure it is accurate. Dittmar points out that inaccurate consumer data can have a range of consequences.

“That’s really very frightening because you have all these algorithms, which are doing credit scoring calculations for insurance or credit scores, and they are based on data that you don’t know about or that can be completely wrong,” Dittmar said.

Over time the personal data stored in the app will be able to generate insight for users by mining data across all their applications.

“You get a completely unique point of view of you,” he said” [8].
