1. [Bikestream-2021-09-03](Bikestream-2021-09-03.md): Some leftover notes on the project. Still unorganized. 
2. [Bikestream-2021_0925-V0.1](Bikestream-2021_0925-V0.1.md): very rough draft on a one-pager for the Bikestream project 
3. [Bikestream-2021_1111-V0.1](Bikestream-2021_1111-V0.1.md): reviewing possible models to follow in developing the Bikestream project (this is the hardest part for me so far *sigh*). I have centered on something similar to CoopCycle and Polypoly Coop. Further work on the project will be on developing a BikePi, Cycling Analytics app, databike data and vehicle specifications, and possibly a bicycle frame design 
4. [Bikestream-2021_1113-V0.1](Bikestream-2021_1113-V0.1.md): some thoughts on applying to the REI Cooperative Action Fund 
5. [Bikestream-2021_1117-V0.1](Bikestream-2021_1117-V0.1.md): wondering about how to add decentralized data storage to the BikePi via IPFS and Pinata.cloud
