# Knowledgebases

I am working on a couple knowledgebases for Ledgerback's Library.

The knowledgebases are:

1. Observatory (a knowledgebase monitoring convergent (connection and integration) and pluralistic actors, organizations, movements, events, protocols, networks and more in the alternative internet (i.e., decentralized web, indieweb, Web3, distributed web)),
	1. `mayve name this the DWeb Convergence Observatory`
2. Glossary (a knowledgebase constructing a convergent glossary of terms  that span and link across communities in the alternative internet, and grey and academic literature),
3. Tools ( a knowledgebase of tools for spanning  the alternative internet, including communities, data-driven apps, social tech, study resources, and more ),
4. [DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1](Garden-1/DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1.md)
5. Question&Answer (Q&A)
	1. probably use for a NLP Q&A system demo
6. Global Tech Commonwealth (GTC) Index
7. Convergence Lit. Rev.



I think I can get a *preview* version of them out pretty soon.


As always, send your feedback to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CAdjovu) account.

## Observatory

 ### Outline
 
 *what do people  need to know*:
`answer big Qs`
1. what will we  do?
2. why crowdfund?
	1.  benefits for crowdfunders
	2.  what money will get used for
2. benefits for stakeholders
3. problems to solve
4. addressing problems

### What is the Observatory

A knowledgebase monitoring convergent (connection and integration) and pluralistic entities (actors, organizations, movements, events, protocols, networks and more) in the alternative internet (i.e., decentralized web, indieweb, Web3, distributed web).

### What are the problems that the Observatory anticipates addressing?

Here is a non-exhasutive list of problems the Observatory  may address:

- hard to map entities converging the decentralized web which makes it easier to navigate the decentralized web
- hard to find entities working in the *background*
- hard for convergent entities to promote themselves because they are at the edges of communities
- finding basic information on the the decentralized web
- hard for beginners to know *where* to search to find sources
- hard to find domain-specific resources

#### Problems we will address

The problems we will specifically address are:

1. map entities and relationships converging the decentralized web 
2. finding domian-specific and other context-specific resources



##### Initial plan to address them

1. Create a database to map entities and relationships
	1. Open database to public for crowdsourcing
2. connect database schema to 3rd party databases
3. 


### What are the benefits of  the Observatory?

### What work is coming out soon from of the Observatory project?

A quick preview of the database and a contribution guide.

Additionally, a newsletter covering updates on the Observatory.

### What future is the Observatory observing towards? (i.e., vision)
A knowledge graph of entities that can be used by multiple apps and stakeholders for their knowledge work.


## Glossary

	1.  benefits for crowdfunders
	2.  what money will get used for

### What is the Glossary

A knowledgebase constructing a convergent glossary of terms that span and link across communities in the decentralized web, and grey and academic literature.

### What are the problems that the Glossary anticipates addressing?

Here is a non-exhasutive list of problems the Glossary  may address:

- inability to connect terms across online communities, domains, contexts, academic and grey literature, and more in decentralized web
- hard to assess terms because of multiple and sometimes conflicting definitions of terms
- hard to track ever-evolving neologisms developing to describe the entities and contexts in the decentralized web
- lack of explainers and analogies of terms across contexts
- hard to relate decentralized web neologisms to older terms
- hard for beginners to know *where* to find a glossary 
- hard to find a glossary that has terms from multiple domains
- trace authorship of terms


#### Problems we will address

The problems we will specifically address are:

1. inability to connect terms across online communities, domains, contexts, and academic and grey literature 
2. lack of explainers and analogies of terms across contexts



##### Initial plan to address them

1. Create a database to map terms and relationships
	1. Open database to public for crowdsourcing
2. connect database schema to 3rd party databases
3. 


### What are the benefits of  the Glossary?

- easy, updateable glossary for stakeholders (e.g., academics, journalists, marketers) to use in their documents

### What work is coming out soon from of the Glossary project?

A quick [preview of the database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JI_t4EXK9fkF2bMt9QE9iNHcJf-sYUvCfmp0Ecp-x4o/edit?usp=sharing) (preview excludes most of the advanced fields) and a contribution guide.

Additionally, a newsletter covering updates on the Glossary.

### What future is the Glossary defining towards? (i.e., vision)
A knowledge graph of terms that can be used by multiple apps and stakeholders for their knowledge work.



## Tools

 *what do people  need to know*:
`answer big Qs`
1. what will we  do?
2. why crowdfund?
	1.  benefits for crowdfunders
	2.  what money will get used for
2. benefits for stakeholders
3. problems to solve
4. addressing problems

### What is the Tools?

A knowledgebase of tools for spanning old and new functions in the decentralized web, including communities, data-driven apps, social tech, study resources, and more.

### What are the problems that the Tools anticipates addressing?

Here is a non-exhasutive list of problems the Glossary  may address:

- inability to connect tools across online communities, domains, contexts,  and more in decentralized web
- hard to develop toolkit that covers social and technical needs of developing decentralized web communities because of multiple, different skills are needed (e.g., a tool to develop Ethereum DApps and tool to develop communities)
- hard to track ever-evolving tools and toolkits in decentralzied web
- lack of explainers and tutorials of tools across contexts
- hard for beginners to know *where* to find tools 
- hard to find experts to teach or mentor how to use tools
- hard to keep track of tools entities use
- hard to know how popular a tool is


#### Problems we will address

The problems we will specifically address are:

1. inability to connect tools across online communities, domains, contexts,  and more in decentralized web
2. lack of explainers and analogies of terms across contexts
3. build toolboxes to meet social and technical needs



##### Initial plan to address them

1. Create a database to map tools and relationships
	1. Open database to public for crowdsourcing
2. connect database schema to 3rd party databases
3. 


### What are the benefits of  the Tools?

- easy, updateable tools repository for stakeholders (e.g., academics, journalists, marketers) to use in their projects
- We will host skill-based webinars to help people learn how to use their tools

### What work is coming out soon from of the Tools project?

A quick [preview of the database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I6yofZNwbZ50ubsyy9x3C89b5KtBIMgXr4GyOgB2YR0/edit?usp=sharing)  (preview excludes most of the advanced fields) and a contribution guide.

Additionally, a newsletter covering updates on the Tools.

### What future is the Tools functioning towards? (i.e., vision)
A knowledge graph of tools that can be used in multiple contexts
