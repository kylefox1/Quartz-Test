# Knowledgebases

I am working on a couple knowledgebases for Ledgerback's Library.

The knowledgebases are:

1. Observatory (a knowledgebase monitoring convergent (connection and integration) and pluralistic actors, organizations, movements, events, protocols, networks and more in the alternative internet (i.e., decentralized web, indieweb, Web3, distributed web)),
	1. `mayve name this the DWeb Convergence Observatory`
2. Glossary (a knowledgebase constructing a convergent glossary of terms  that span and link across communities in the alternative internet, and grey and academic literature),
3. Tools ( a knowledgebase of tools for spanning  the alternative internet, including communities, data-driven apps, social tech, study resources, and more ),
4. [DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1](Garden-1/DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1.md)
5. Question&Answer (Q&A)
	1. probably use for a NLP Q&A system demo
6. Global Tech Commonwealth (GTC) Index
7. Convergence Lit. Rev.
8. Solutions
	1. [Backyard_BrainTrust-2021-1004-V0.1](Garden-1/Backyard_BrainTrust-2021-1004-V0.1.md)



I think I can get a *preview* version of them out pretty soon.


As always, send your feedback to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CAdjovu) account.

## Observatory

 ### Outline
 
 *what do people  need to know*:
`answer big Qs`
1. what will we  do?
2. why crowdfund?
	1.  benefits for crowdfunders
	2.  what money will get used for
2. benefits for stakeholders
3. problems to solve
4. addressing problems

### What is the Observatory

A knowledgebase monitoring convergent (connection and integration) and pluralistic entities (actors, organizations, movements, events, protocols, networks and more) in the alternative internet (i.e., decentralized web, indieweb, Web3, distributed web).

### What are the problems that the Observatory anticipates addressing?

Here is a non-exhasutive list of problems the Observatory  may address:

- hard to map entities converging the decentralized web which makes it easier to navigate the decentralized web
- hard to find entities working in the *background*
- hard for convergent entities to promote themselves because they are at the edges of communities
- finding basic information on the the decentralized web
- hard for beginners to know *where* to search to find sources
- hard to find domain-specific resources

#### Problems we will address

The problems we will specifically address are:

1. map entities and relationships converging the decentralized web 
2. finding domian-specific and other context-specific resources



##### Initial plan to address them

1. Create a database to map entities and relationships
	1. Open database to public for crowdsourcing
2. connect database schema to 3rd party databases
3. 


### What are the benefits of  the Observatory?

### What work is coming out soon from of the Observatory project?

A quick preview of the database and a contribution guide.

Additionally, a newsletter covering updates on the Observatory.

### What future is the Observatory observing towards? (i.e., vision)
A knowledge graph of entities that can be used by multiple apps and stakeholders for their knowledge work.

Making a searchable dashboard. Maybe like https://twitter.com/dmihal/status/1389960811020488708 & https://openorgs.info/

Provides a public API for easy access to data.


## Glossary

 ### Outline
 
 *what do people  need to know*:
`answer big Qs`
1. what will we  do?
2. why crowdfund?
	1.  benefits for crowdfunders
	2.  what money will get used for
2. benefits for stakeholders
3. problems to solve
4. addressing problems

### What is the Glossary

A knowledgebase constructing a convergent glossary of terms that span and link across communities in the decentralized web, and grey and academic literature.

### What are the problems that the Glossary anticipates addressing?

Here is a non-exhasutive list of problems the Glossary  may address:

- inability to connect terms across online communities, domains, contexts, academic and grey literature, and more in decentralized web
- hard to assess terms because of multiple and sometimes conflicting definitions of terms
- hard to track ever-evolving neologisms developing to describe the entities and contexts in the decentralized web
- lack of explainers and analogies of terms across contexts
- hard to relate decentralized web neologisms to older terms
- hard for beginners to know *where* to find a glossary 
- hard to find a glossary that has terms from multiple domains
- trace authorship of terms
- > [_Terminology shapes reality_. What’s true for the phenomena that we address _in_ our research is certainly also true for the terminology we use _for_ our research. What at first sounded like a banal truism, for us gradually evolved into the idea for this project, establishing a new special section _Defining concepts of the digital society_. At a time, when branding new, occasionally innovative but often only catchy terms has become a familiar activity of researchers, companies and policymakers alike, we felt it was particularly necessary to reflect on which of these concepts was actually worthwhile, provided analytic value and actually described something new – besides the fluffy rhetoric that repeatedly becomes rampant in academic discourse.](https://policyreview.info/concepts/defining-concepts-digital-society)
- > [There is high demand for concepts and explanations that condense the complexity of the world by transforming it into cogent and manageable ideas. Empirical research typically addresses single aspects of the current transformations. Adding small pieces to the puzzle, individual reports, research papers and essays tend to be rather unconnected, sometimes even resisting being combined with each other. While they certainly have a heuristic value, for example by validating or falsifying assumptions for well-defined, yet restricted contexts, they cannot provide overarching explanations and narratives. This is where more abstract concepts come into the picture. Operating on the level of middle range theories, they are able to integrate diverse phenomena under one notion by foregrounding certain shared characteristics. We need those overarching concepts to make sense of the current transformations.](https://policyreview.info/concepts/defining-concepts-digital-society)

### What are the benefits of  the Glossary?

- easy, updateable glossary for stakeholders (e.g., academics, journalists, marketers) to use in their documents

### What work is coming out soon from of the Glossary project?

A quick [preview of the database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JI_t4EXK9fkF2bMt9QE9iNHcJf-sYUvCfmp0Ecp-x4o/edit?usp=sharing) (preview excludes most of the advanced fields) and a contribution guide.

Additionally, a newsletter covering updates on the Glossary.

A knowledgebase of tools for spanning old and new functions in the decentralized web, including communities, data-driven apps, social tech, study resources, and more.

### What are the problems that the Tools anticipates addressing?

Here is a non-exhasutive list of problems the Glossary  may address:

- inability to connect tools across online communities, domains, contexts,  and more in decentralized web
- hard to develop toolkit that covers social and technical needs of developing decentralized web communities because of multiple, different skills are needed (e.g., a tool to develop Ethereum DApps and tool to develop communities)
- hard to track ever-evolving tools and toolkits in decentralzied web
- lack of explainers and tutorials of tools across contexts
- hard for beginners to know *where* to find tools 
- hard to find experts to teach or mentor how to use tools
- hard to keep track of tools entities use
- hard to know how popular a tool is


#### Problems we will address

The problems we will specifically address are:

1. inability to connect tools across online communities, domains, contexts,  and more in decentralized web
2. lack of explainers and analogies of terms across contexts
3. build toolboxes to meet social and technical needs



##### Initial plan to address them

1. Create a database to map tools and relationships
	1. Open database to public for crowdsourcing
2. connect database schema to 3rd party databases
