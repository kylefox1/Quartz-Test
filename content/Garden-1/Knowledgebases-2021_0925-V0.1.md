# Knowledgebases

I am working on a couple knowledgebases for Ledgerback's Library.

The knowledgebases are:

1. Observatory (a knowledgebase monitoring convergent (connection and integration) and pluralistic actors, organizations, movements, events, protocols, networks and more in the alternative internet (i.e., decentralized web, indieweb, Web3, distributed web)),
2. Glossary (a knowledgebase constructing a convergent glossary of terms  that span and link across communities in the alternative internet, and grey and academic literature),
3. Tools ( a knowledgebase of tools for spanning  the alternative internet, including communities, data-driven apps, social tech, study resources, and more ),
4. [DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1](DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1.md)
5. Question&Answer (Q&A)
6. Global Tech Commonwealth (GTC) Index
7. Convergence Lit. Rev.



I think I can get a *preview* version of them out pretty soon.
