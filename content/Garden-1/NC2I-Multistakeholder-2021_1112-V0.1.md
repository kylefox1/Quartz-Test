Thoughts on converting the Association to a multi-stakeholder cooperative association to aid in executing the Networked-Cognitive Cooperative Institute (NC2I).

# Classes

1. Worker/Expert
2. Consumer
3. Philanthropist
4. User/Developer (i.e., Licensees)
5. Staff `recently included. May change to *worker* later.`
6. Supporters

# Why multi-stakeholder?

Multi-stakeholder makes the most sense because the Association's outputs are wide and varied. As a research cooperative, the Association is akin to a research institute (and possibly a professional society), thus the additional types the Association can include (based on outputs or goods/services):

1. Data
2. Tech
3. Media
4. Invention 
5. Education

Because the outputs are so varied, the Association's stakeholders can include multiple types of people seeking different needs and wanting to explore different interests.  

Additionally, based on the NC2I, the Association is expected to be a connection platform (i.e., matchmaking platform) `can also say that this is making a a network`, that acts as a hub for indepednent scholars/cognitives (knowledge creators in general).

Additionally, after examining other research cooperatives and education cooperatives, I came to the conclusion that most knowledge-based markets are 2+ sided markets, thus precipitating the existence of a platform. A multi-stakhoelder model makes sense because the market a research institute exists in is a 4+ sided market compsoed of the following stakeholders:

1. Donors
2. Beneficiaries
3. Experts 
4. Consumers 
`Staff are also stakeholders, but from a market perspective, I do not think they should be included.`
To give every stakeholder a say in the cooperative and to meet the differnet utility each stakeholder, a multi-stakeholder model is the most appropriate.
