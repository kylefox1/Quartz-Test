Starting to look into **training/coaching programs** and events  as a marketplace.

## Notes 

- [Bikestream-based Data Cooperative services based on Platoon Co-ops](https://anchor.fm/philomath-ledgerback/episodes/Charles-Adjovu-on-Bikestream-based-Data-Cooperative-services-based-on-Platoon-Co-ops-e16t49e): I discusses the services a [Bikestream](https://github.com/Ledgerback/Bikestream)-based Mobility Data Cooperative can offer based on features from [Platoon Co-ops](https://trust.support/feed/platoon-coops) by Beth McCarthy and Daniel Shavit.
- [Databike Report](https://www.hackster.io/ledgerback/databike-report-5eb9c2): a follow-up report on the development of our databike zeta 001 (DBZ-001) proof-of-concept (PoC), a converted e-bike with a Raspberry Pi that can process data and stream it to an external data marketplace via Streamr. 
- [Github Repository ](https://github.com/Ledgerback/Bikestream): This is where the software is stored and some notes on the project.
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2427813/ledgerback_digital_commons_research_cooperative/collections/BG5BMX4X): Here you can a bibliography for the project 
- [# Charles Adjovu on implementing Access Control in Bikestream with Token Gates (TGs) via Unlock Protocol](https://anchor.fm/philomath-ledgerback/episodes/Charles-Adjovu-on-implementing-Access-Control-in-Bikestream-with-Token-Gates-TGs-via-Unlock-Protocol-e164ptq):  I discuss how [Bikestream](https://github.com/Ledgerback/Bikestream) and Token-locked Gates (TLGs) or Token Gates (TGs) via the [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/) or [Mintgate](https://www.mintgate.io/) can be implemented for securing access to, and sharing, databikes, based on [Austin Robey's](https://twitter.com/austinrobey_) [Token-gated physical spaces (an experimental recipe)](https://club.mirror.xyz/Iutxpw3iidtxPs1drAq3pkb0Kn5MU_KLri0r0nNCsNA)
- [# Charles Adjovu on implementing Bikestream based on A Novel Crowdsourcing Model for Micro-Mobility Ride-Sharing Systems](https://anchor.fm/philomath-ledgerback/episodes/Charles-Adjovu-on-implementing-Bikestream-based-on-A-Novel-Crowdsourcing-Model-for-Micro-Mobility-Ride-Sharing-Systems-e164ojk):  I discuss how [Bikestream](https://github.com/Ledgerback/Bikestream) and a Mobility Data Cooperative can be implemented for a Crowdsourced Bike Sharing System (BSS), based on [Mohammed Elhenawy](https://sciprofiles.com/profile/author/ajZaREpLQTQrRGtWSWNwL2VLMlpOYld6cXNSSDdhTVk0SDZkWk8zUXdFST0=) et al.'s [A Novel Crowdsourcing Model for Micro-Mobility Ride-Sharing Systems](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/14/4636), and responding to [Nicolas Saravia](https://www.researchhub.com/user/869772/overview)'s issues with the model.
