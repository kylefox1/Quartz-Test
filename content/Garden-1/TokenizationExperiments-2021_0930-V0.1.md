title: "Tokenization"
---

A list of Web3 and Tokenization experiments I have been thinking about.

1. Trying out [Fuse](https://fuse.io/) for Bikestream and Laplace
2. Making a liquidity pool with [Balancer](http://balancer.fi/)
3. Provide memberships to the coop as NFTs through Unlock, 
4. use Snapshot for governance, 
5. make a Scout Stork NFT,
6. $SCHOLAR tokens to  advance the scholarly currency network (mentioned in SDCI slides)
7. Minting an NFT of an article and auctioning it off
8. Tokenizing quizzes
	1. giving tokens to people who complete beginner quizzes, and then requiring tokens to be used or proof of their existence for higher level quizzes?
9. **Prediction market** for Knowledge Frontier 
10. Creating a contribution-tracking token ($LEDGERBACK) for people who complete bounties on the LDCRC Volunteer Board. If people earn enough tokens, then I will send them a badge as an NFT 
	1. [DAOification-WaterMusic-2021_1112](Garden-1/DAOification-WaterMusic-2021_1112.md)
11. Creating a protocol to incentivize people to connect schemas between knowledge graphs using category theory (or just incentivizing people to use one standardized format for the knowledge graph schema)
12. Requiring students in a training session to deposit funds into a prize pool on PoolTogether and re-distributing funds back to students once the class is over (a portion of the interest goes towards the teacher)
	1. Based on [Pragma](https://medium.com/@usepragmatic/introducing-pragma-de746603488b)
