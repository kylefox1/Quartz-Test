title: "Tokenization"
---

A list of Web3 and Tokenization experiments I have been thinking about.

1. Trying out [Fuse](https://fuse.io/) for Bikestream and Laplace
2. Making a liquidity pool with [Balancer](http://balancer.fi/)
3. Provide memberships to the coop as NFTs through Unlock, 
4. use Snapshot for governance, 
5. make a Scout Stork NFT,
6. $SCHOLAR tokens to  advance the scholarly currency network (mentioned in SDCI slides)
7. Minting an NFT of an article and auctioning it off
8. Tokenizing quizzes
9. **Prediction market** for Knowledge Frontier
