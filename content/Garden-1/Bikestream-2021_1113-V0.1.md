# REI Cooperative Action Fund

I sent an email asking the Fund to review the Bikestream project as a potential grantee. 

I think Bikestream has a good chance because it can encourage people to go outdoors to cycle, and also an educational side on making people aware of the value of managing their data and micro-mobiltiy vehicles. 

I really like this grantee, [Black Girls Do Bike](https://www.reifund.org/grantees/black-girls-do-bike). Additionally, it is making me think that I should make (preferrably someone else) an event where people with converted e-bikes with BikePis race with each other.
