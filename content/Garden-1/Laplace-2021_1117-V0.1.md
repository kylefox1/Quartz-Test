# Laplace in light of Yext's training platform
Laplace is also to help people test knowledge and earn badges, also people can communicate on the Discourse or Discord forums

  

> [Join Hitchhikers, the new Yext training platform and community, to test your knowledge, earn badges, and engage with the experts.](https://www.yext.com/platform/answers)

  

Ask people to contribute by making quizzes/challenges on content in Laplace that does not have a quiz or for new situations (additionally, adding badges and ranks to people for curating content, making/taking quizzes (and other assessments), designing new courses (or just suggesting them?), making learning paths, and participating on Laplace). Similar to Yext?
