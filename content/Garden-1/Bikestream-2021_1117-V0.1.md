# Data Storage

The BikePi can also be used for storing vehicle and geolocation data (or any sensor data that is manipulated by the BikePi) on the IPFS. 

Some articles I am looking at on how to do this with a Raspberry Pi:

1. [# HOW TO INSTALL IPFS ON RASPBERRY PI](https://etanoox.me/raspberry-pi/how-to-install-ipfs-on-raspberry-pi/)
2. [# Raspberry Pi Headless IPFS Setup](https://desertbot.io/blog/raspberry-pi-headless-ipfs-setup)

And also on using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/pricing) as a pinning service for the IPFS.

I think this will primarily be for people who want to store their data in the cloud *without the cloud*. 

# Docs

I am also working on making some docs for the Bikestream project so that people have a clearer idea than the databike report article on:

1. how to make a databike, specfically the Databike Zeta 001 (DBZ-001)
2. how to download and run the software in the Bikestream GitHub repository on their own Raspberry Pis
3. how to share their data on Streamr
4. Standards for the project (data format specification and databike specifications)

The docs are based on [ADS-B Exchange]() for now
