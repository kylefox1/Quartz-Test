These notes are arranged chronologically. I provide a short summary for each note. 


## DAO Index
2. [DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_1111-V0.1](Garden-1/DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_1111-V0.1.md): Updates on a design for a certification mark, survey design for DAO index and first analysis of dOrg, and future thoughts on an open rating system based on the DAO Index
2. [DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1](Garden-1/DGov_Score-DAO_Index-2021_0921-V0.1): My first update on the project since April/May 2020. I explain the need for a new survey design and the organizing principles or dimensions that I believe bring all DAOs together. Additionally, some very infomrative readings that helped me rethink the project and get back to putting some work on it. 
	1. Readings
		1. [Is a DAO a Panopticon? Algorithmic governance as creating and mitigating vulnerabilities in "Decentralised Autonomous Organisations"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3907693)
		2. [ A Prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)	
3. [Github Repository](): The Github repo stores the docs for the project before my work on the DAO Index. You can find most of the theoretical background for the project here.
