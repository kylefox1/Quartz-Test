title: "DAO Index"
---

Quick update.

I am trying a new version of the assessment based on the Framework that disconnects the organizing principles of DAOs from:

1. Other digital organizations, 
2. Participant experience, and
2. Performance.

This assessment specifically focuses on the organizing principles of DAOs (hereafter DAO Index).

Additionally, the assessment test this time will use a standard format for all questions, which should make self- and outsider-assessment easier. I think the use of a non-standard format and compressing multiple metrics (performance, participant experience) into one assessment made the DGov Assessment too impractical and wore me out :frowning_face:. Additionally, the assessment attempted to be too quantitative, especially considering that many of the features that we want to understand about DAOs are qualitative (and are too subjective, with one reason being the evolving evolution of the term).

I expect to assess DAOs based on a set of indicators and questions based on these 11 organizing principles:

1. Broad stakeholder participation






































2. Introducing value in relations which have been historically denied, such as labor and environment, rather than creating new financialized relations.






3. cross-border coordination







4. practicing DAO cooperativism













5. Developing cultural patterns (e.g., neologisms)












6. Information & Data Transparency















7. DAO2DAO interaction









8. Embracing social tech




9. Human-centered Algorithmic Governance





10. Community-owned Peer Production (Use-value of production held by community)



11. Supporting public goods














The questions are yes/no and allow for partial points. The points range is 0 - 100 (can normalize to 0 - 1), with:

* Yes: 100,
* Partial: 50,
* No: 0,
* N/A: 0
 
Hopefully, you guys find the assessment more useful this time. 

Currently, I am working on developing the indicators and questions. You can find the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zcapyF1aOx_DIv8JGMtxD7bMkqkN99SrJmBM8q0_pIk/edit?usp=sharing).

It is still in the early stages but I would like to get your feedback on anything and everything about the DAO Index. 

The first organization I will be evaluating is [dOrg](https://www.deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dao/0x15344ecdc2c4edfcb092e284d93c20f0529fd8a6/topLevel).

For your personal use, I recommend using the DAO's official website and docs, DeepDAO and Govbase as data sources.

And some helpful readings to contextualize the DAO Index's organizing principles:
