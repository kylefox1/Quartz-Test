## Cool Projects

The [AI Edu Project](https://aiedu.org/homepage/#aiforum-contact-form-01) is an interesting project and I think it touches a core area or purpose of Laplace, which is to help map the extent of knowledge in the Ledgerback Frontier. 

I will add it to Laplace. Not sure as a learning path or as a school or both. 

I think Laplace can help the AI Edu project by adding the project to the site and discussing the project in the Laplace Newsletter. This will provide an additional communication channel for the project.

This has got me thinking that I should aggregate courses on these topics first:

1. Instructional Design
2. Tools for Thought (TfT)
3. Artificial Intelligence
4. Blockchain & Web3
5. Data Science
6. Data-related courses (e.g., data ethics, data literacy)
7. Sustainability
8. Tech Ethics & Philosophy
9. Cooperatives
10. Metascience 
11. Organizational management
