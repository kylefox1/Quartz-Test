<em>)</em></p><p><strong>NFTs — A new world changing asset class</strong></p><p>I have compiled this information to help people understand the origin projects out of which the NFT movement has emerged.</p><p>I apologise in advance for the length of this article. It is intended as a useful reference document rather than a leisurely read.</p><p>I contend that we are living in a unique emergence period of a new asset class that will radically disrupt many elements of the way our society operates and how we live. Given this, I believe great value will be attributed to the very earliest of these assets and innovative projects that have pioneered this new paradigm. We have already seen this dynamic start to play out. However, there remain some largely unknown and undervalued digital relics that this article will provide some information about.</p><p>Bitcoin (via the Counterparty internet protocol) played a very dominant role in the very earliest of NFTs/tokenised assets. This was then followed by a strong shift of focus and activity to the Ethereum chain. Given this history, I have divided the NFT emergence period into what I’ve described as the ‘golden era of NFTs’ (2014–2016) and the ‘silver era of NFTs’ (2017 onwards).</p><p>The significance of these origin assets being tokenised to bitcoin should not be overlooked in terms of the security, decentralisation and longevity that this provides. Being on the ‘origin chain’ is appropriately poetic too I might add.</p><p>At the moment, access to trade BTC assets is via
<a href=https://xchain.io/dispensers rel=noopener>Counterparty</a>
or the use of
<a href=https://circuitsofvalue.com/ rel=noopener>‘Emblem Vaults</a>
’ on
<a href=https://opensea.io/collection/emblem-vault rel=noopener>OpenSea</a>
. I would suggest these temporary entry barriers are your friend right now - as it has helped reduce broader market access for now. Therefore the curious and the tenacious will be rewarded ahead of what will soon be open and fully integrated chain-agnostic market platforms which are currently in development. At that time there will be full market access and exposure to these early treasures. To help you navigate the learning curve in this space I recommend these forums:
<a href=https://discord.gg/uMXp8szvhr rel=noopener>Rare Pepe Trading Club</a>
and

However, it doesn’t need to be that complex. The use of the word ‘NFT’ by the market has now evolved and gone well beyond its original technical definition of being a non-fungible 1/1 item. Rather, the term ‘NFT’ is now being used to refer to any tokenized digital asset that is verifiably scarce. Bottom line is, value is not attributed to an asset on the basis of a technical definition. Rather, the very moment that a digital item could be tokenized to chain and thus become verifiably scarce — that was the moment that the market forces of supply and demand leaped into action and ascribed that item value. The market has voted with its feet, and has well demonstrated that silly arguments over NFT semantics are now moot.</p><p><strong>The need for a factual narrative & giving due recognition</strong></p><p>I have chosen to provide this timeline of projects overlaid with Rogers Adoption Curve for a couple of reasons:</p><p>a) To illustrate my assessment of just how early we all are in this space, and the significant interest and demand to come.</p><p>b) To highlight just how far out in front of this innovation curve some these very early blockchain projects actually were.</p><p>I wish to highlight this because there has been an unfortunate and inaccurate narrative that had gripped the market which overlooked some of the most important innovators and most influential projects that first pioneered this NFT space. Specifically, there has been an inaccurate notion that this new movement of NFTs started with cryptopunks.</p><p>The market is now starting to realize that this was not the case, and that there were several innovative and influential projects that came well before it. These facts do not diminish the historical significance and value of cyptopunks (I’m a fan and include cryptopunks in my holdings), however it is important that the earliest of innovators and projects are also given due recognition for their role in this world changing technology.</p><p>There are a number of people to whom this refers, and I’m not able to list them all here, however I am especially wishing to draw attention to the important place in history that
<a href=https://twitter.com/shaban_shaame rel=noopener>Shaban Shaame</a>
, and
<a href=https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf rel=noopener>Joe Looney</a>
hold due to their very early pioneering work with the projects Spells of Genesis and Rare Pepes respectively (amongst other projects).</p><p>As outlined in the information below, these two projects have triggered a chain of events and a subsequent NFT movement that has reverberated around the world and will ultimately expand beyond most of our imaginings.</p><p>Similarly, the pioneering work of Etheria has been too long over-shadowed by this erroneous narrative, and it too is deserving of credit and recognition. I have great respect for the early genius of the Etheria developer who launched the project only 3 months after Ethereum went live. I can only hope the founder also comes to recognize that no-one can nor should seek to control the revolutionary decentralized technology that this project had been so quick to to leverage. Etheria v1.1 and v1.2 are both historically significant and will forever be valued existing independently on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>There are many others also deserving of recognition for their pioneering work including
<a href=https://twitter.com/MandelDuck rel=noopener>Christian Moss</a>
and
<a href=https://twitter.com/Coin_and_Peace rel=noopener>Koji Higashi</a>
who also contributed to the very early Counterparty projects, as well as Kevin McCoy & Anil Dash(Namecoin, Monegraph) and of course Matt and John from Larva Labs who created such an innovative and iconic project (Cryptopunks) that has become the face of the NFT market. These various early projects are not competitors. They are complementary, and together with the various others listed in this article form the rich history of this world changing technology.</p><p>Similarly, the vintage assets associated with these projects do not compete for value, but rather, together they form the early digital antiquities market. There is no limit to the supply of tokenized assets that will emerge in future, but there is an iron-clad hard cap on the scarcity of those in the past. This timeline and article has sought to map these out for you (well, all those that are known at the time of writing).</p><p><em>NB. The dark horse that I believe will soon further amend the NFT historical narrative will be the early achievements of Namecoin, which for the moment remain largely unknown to the market.</em></p><p><strong>House Keeping — BTC Assets Wallet (via Counterparty)</strong></p><p>If you are seeking to purchase BTC/Counterparty assets you’ll need a compatible wallet, or else to understand how Emblem Vaults work on Ethereum.

.</p><p><strong>Important information before we get to the good stuff</strong></p><p>a) I have tried to cover a lot of ground and in so doing have kept the information on each project to a minimum for quick reference. I certainly have not gone into the depth that is required to do justice to each of these amazing early pioneering projects. I recommend you undertake further research to better understand and appreciate their rich history.</p><p>b) I have tried to provide as accurate information as possible, but I know that there will inevitably be errors. There may also be some projects that I have missed, and if that is the case I apologise in advance. It is important to me that the accurate historical narrative attributes credit where credit is due. If you identify any errors/omissions pls advise me and I will seek to incorporate edits where possible.</p><p>c) The information I provide is my opinion only and is not financial advice. It is important you do your own due diligence and draw your own conclusions.</p><p>d) I am a collector of vintage tokenised assets, and — full disclosure — naturally I do hold a number of the assets described in this article because I do believe in their worth. However, rather than this being an attempt to ‘shill my bags’ I simply offer insight into the

that I have applied for some time now and some additional information that can help you access these vintage assets which are often unknown to the market or difficult to locate.</p><p>e) I have tried to provide some value to readers through the information provided, however I am not a trained expert in this field. I would at all times defer to the expertise of

Quantum</strong> (02 May 14) <strong>Blockheads</strong> (2014–2015) <strong>Comicons</strong> (2014–2015) <strong>CryptoEggs</strong> (2014–2017)</h1><p><em>Some of this content regarding Namecoin projects has been provided by @EarlyNFT</em></p><p>There are few within the market that understand the significance and innovation of Namecoin which holds the very first NFTs that were ever created. These NFTs are ancient ‘prehistoric’ treasures that will no doubt become better known soon as they find their way onto the open market.</p><p>Namecoin became the first hard fork of Bitcoin back in 2011. Originally known as BitDNS, Namecoin is noteworthy as being the only other blockchain that Satoshi Nakamoto (and Gavin Andresen) contributed to and publicly supported. This is well documented on the BitcoinTalk forum. Namecoin’s original intended purpose is to free speech from censorship by decentralizing the domain name system. Only in 2013–2014 did a company called OneName build a platform to use Namecoin for their decentralized identity platform and hence the need for avatars.</p><p>Namecoin remains to this day one of the most decentralized chains in existence due to the way it is co-mined together with bitcoin.</p><p><strong>Quantum</strong></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/38/1*Mm4RQcQ2hPdBHhYKeWjvBA.gif?q=20" alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/450/1*Mm4RQcQ2hPdBHhYKeWjvBA.gif alt></p><p>This is believed to be the very earliest cryptoart NFT — which was done so on Namecoin.</p><p>This original artwork by Kevin McCoy was more recently retokenized to Ethereum and sold at a Sotheby’s auction in June 2021 for $1.4M. However, there is some significant controversy relating to this sale.</p><p>The public were advised that that the original ‘token’ had been destroyed and for this reason it was reissued on Ethereum. However, new information has emerged indicating that the original asset may have simply failed to be renewed (a feature of Namecoin) and was claimed by a new owner once it had expired.</p><p>This therefore raises the question about which is the ‘original artwork’? Is it the retokenised work by the artist or the original token? To answer that, there is legal minefield to walk through in terms of digital ownership and IP in this very new NFT paradigm. The recent buyer of Quantum has subsequently expressed confidence in regards to having genuine ownership of ‘Quantum’, whilst the current owner of the original Namecoin token is equally confident in their ownership. One thing is for sure, this is not going to be the last controversy over ownership rights to emerge in this emerging space as significant value is increasingly attributed to these assets.</p><p><strong>Sources and Other useful links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6258820256001#sp=show-clips" rel=noopener>https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6258820256001#sp=show-clips</a></p><p><a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/ rel=noopener>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/</a></p><p><strong>Blockheads</strong></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*gQ-HIuDx9Nd48b_lYmMI3g.png?q=20" alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*gQ-HIuDx9Nd48b_lYmMI3g.png alt></p><p>These are amongst the earliest NFTs ever created and the earliest known PFPs (Profile Pictures) which significantly pre-date the popular 2020/21 PFP movement. Blockheads were not created with the intent to be a collectable, but rather as a unique avatar representation of an individual’s digital identity tokenised to Namecoin.</p><p>The drawings actually look very similar to the iconic Cryptopunks. The punks were released into the wild by LarvaLabs in 2017, but given the remarkable similarities, it would appear that they may have been inspired by this much earlier project minted on Namecoin. Blockheads have a 4-bit design and a similar pixelated look.</p><p>LarvaLabs produced 10,000 Cryptopunks, however in contrast it is estimated that there are only 35–45 Blockheads NFTs in existence. All Blockheads are 1/1s and may themselves have been modelled after the popular pixel art figures from world of Minecraft.</p><p><strong>ComicCons</strong></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*KUBvZ-c92-k80Cbg0LhFOg.png?q=20" alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*KUBvZ-c92-k80Cbg0LhFOg.png alt></p><p>The ComicCons avatars are more modern looking avatars than your ‘typical’ 2014 NFT. The ComicCons NFTs are the middle ground behind the old school pixel avatars and the current hyper caricatures we see being minted in 2021. Characters like Insane Moe and TallSam look more like Garbage Pail Kids than the real world individuals whose likeness we may never know. The avatars were created using the program ‘
<a href=https://www.faceyourmanga.com/ rel=noopener>FaceYourManga</a>
’. The variability available to users of the program had a wide range of features they could select from to settle on a look that best represents them in the digital space. Pair the avatar’s trait customizability with their being ‘one of ones’ and you have a set of NFTs with genuine rarity.</p><p><strong>CryptoEggs (Twitter Eggs)</strong></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*j8caDPXtquvMPbNehij2mg.png?q=20" alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/625/1*j8caDPXtquvMPbNehij2mg.png alt></p><p>These eggs were issued automatically by Twitter between 2014–2017 for new users. They would sit in the place of avatars until the user added their own pictures. However, the problem arose that people become quite fond of their colorful eggs and kept using them instead of replacing them with a profile picture. To address this the eggs were subsequently dropped for the more familiar and mundane ‘shadow’ avatar that we see today. Some however immortalized their original Twitter eggs by tokenizing them on Namecoin.</p><p>There are roughly 200–220 CryptoEggs that reside on Namecoin and were minted between September 2014 — September 2015. Ordered from most common to most rare: Purple, Green, Light Orange, Red, Grey, Dark Orange, Green-Blue, Blue, Neon Green and Light Blue.</p><p>As we increasingly move toward new chain-agnostic market platforms, it is expected that more vintage Namecoin assets will be available in the marketplace.

The FDCARD is the first of many firsts…</p><p>It is the first collectable ever tokenized to chain (and was before Ethereum went live). FDCARD is card #1 within the Spells of Genesis game which was the first game to leverage blockchain for in game assets (aside from currency purposes), Therefore, the FDCARD is in fact the first tokenized asset of any game… ever.</p><p>The FDCARD is also one of the very first instances of tokenized cryptoart (Artist:
<a href=https://www.artstation.com/alexhurtado rel=noopener>Alejandro Hurtado</a>
).</p><p>The company
<a href=https://www.everdreamsoft.com/ rel=noopener>EverdreamSoft</a>
, founded by
<a href=https://twitter.com/shaban_shaame rel=noopener>Shaban Shaame</a>
leveraged the
<a href=https://counterparty.io/ rel=noopener>Counterparty platform</a>
to tokenize a series of assets on the bitcoin blockchain for use in their game
<a href=https://spellsofgenesis.com/ rel=noopener>Spells of Genesis</a>
which still remains active today. The original tokenized assets are now highly sought after collectibles constituting historical artefacts that pioneered the emergence of this entire new asset class and the associated industries and economies that are now emerging from it.</p><p>There were 300 FDCARDs tokenized on 11 March 2015. They were originally distributed to participants of the innovative
<a href=https://foldingcoin.net/ rel=noopener>FoldingCoin project</a>
as a reward for contributing their idle computational power towards a collective effort with involvement by Stamford University to find cures to diseases. The card was distributed in a fractionalized manner (a feature made possible by Counterparty), so that many recipients may have only received a portion of an FDCARD. The nature of this early distribution method in 2015 at a time when ‘tokenized assets’ were not well understood, means that a large proportion of FDCARDs have been left in forgotten wallets and forever ‘lost to the ages’. In fact, at the time of writing there are only 87 whole 1.0 FDCARDS left in active wallets (this figure can change), and only enough fractions remaing in active wallets for 100 whole 1.0 FDCARDs to still be reassembled. Thus, the lucky holders of an FDCARD make up a very small and limited group forming what could be described as the <strong>Origin #100 Club</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*Q7wTZA_x_3M7sKxaX6ix5g.png?q=20" alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*Q7wTZA_x_3M7sKxaX6ix5g.png alt></p><p>FDCARD Holdings Analysis</p><p>A number of other Spells of Genesis assets were also tokenized around the same the time, such as the revered
<a href=https://sogassets.com/top/SATOSHICARD rel=noopener>SATOSHICARD</a>
(24 June, 2015). There were originally 1000 of these issued, however 800 were subsequently burned, therefore leaving only 200 for collectors to seek out. Over the course of the past 5 years it is uncertain how many more have been left in abandoned wallets and forever lost which would further reduce the available supply.</p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*GleY-ptlX0Fbsu5N_-cpYw.jpeg alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/713/1*Wz8H5tgX4ojZuGnXwiTPhQ.gif alt></p><p>The 1st ever metaverse asset — the SATOSHICARD, showing how it manifests in the games Spells of Genesis and SarutobiIsland</p><p>Incredibly, through a collaboration between Spells of Genesis and Sarutobi, the SATOSHICARD is recognized as the first ever tokenized metaverse asset. The same asset/token was integrated into the two games by two different devs, providing different utility in each. This was the humble birth of metaverse, and served to be the first crack in the walled gardens of the multibillion dollar gaming industry. Over time the earth shattering significance of this innovation will become better known as these concepts work their way through. It is my firm belief that the degree of disruption this technology will bring to the worldwide multi-billion dollar gaming industry will ultimately cause it to be divided into two epochs, Pre-Ownership and Post-Ownership. Future generations will be bemused at the thought of people investing substantial money into games and assets that then had to simply be left on the gaming servers when one tired of the game.</p><p>This impending disruption all started here with the FDCARD, the SATOSHICARD and the other assets within the Spells of Genesis game.</p><p>The game itself was in beta by Sep 2016 and then released in May 2017, and remains active to this day. Spells of Genesis have released over 400 blockchain assets between 2015 and 2019, all with varying images, meanings and rarities. Adding to the unique value of the Spells of Genesis assets, EverdreamSoft took the visionary decision to incorporate into their tokenized cards a representation of rich historical events throughout early blockchain history. Therefore, the game assets and their associated artwork preserves a historical narrative of this important emergence period for posterity. A few examples of these include: SATOSHILITE — “The Imitator”, GOXCARD — “The stealing of Mountain Gox”, BLOCKSIZECD — “Battle for Block Size”, ETHERERUMCARD — “Sir of the Ether”, and many more.</p><p><strong>Chain:</strong> Bitcoin (Counterparty)</p><p><strong>Issuance:</strong></p><p>There were 300 FDCARDs minted, however many of these are believed to be lost to inaccessible wallets due to the unusual early distribution method. At the time of writing there were just 87 that remain intact as full cards in active wallets.</p><p>There were 1000 SATOSHICARDs issued, and subsequently 800 were burned leaving just 200 of these elite vintage collector’s items to be fought over.</p><p>There are over 300 Spells of Genesis cards of varying issuance numbers from 200–3000, with many dating back to 2015.</p><p><strong>Current Prices:</strong></p><p><em>FDCARD</em></p><p>Given the rarity and significance of this asset there has been little market activity, therefore it difficult to determine a floor. The current lowest price on OpenSea is 120 ETH, and then it moves up to 540 ETH.</p><p><em>SATOSHICARD</em></p><p>Similarly, there has been little market activity, therefore it difficult to determine a floor. The current lowest price on OpenSea is 90 ETH.</p><p><em>Other SoG Cards:</em></p><p>There is a broad range of prices available for the other cards in the series. These vary in prices. Given these are the first set of collectibles ever tokenized to chain as well as the first blockchain gaming assets, I expect the Spells of Genesis cards to be some of the most highly sought after digital assets by collectors into the near future.</p><p><strong>Marketplaces to purchase asset:</strong></p><p><a href=https://sogassets.com/assets rel=noopener>https://sogassets.com/assets</a></p><p><a href=https://xchain.io/dispensers rel=noopener>https://xchain.io/dispensers</a></p><p><a href=https://goodman.auction/ rel=noopener>https://goodman.auction/</a></p><p><a href=https://t.me/wthauctionhouse rel=noopener>https://t.me/wthauctionhouse</a></p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/emblem-vault-matic?search%5bresultModel%5d=ASSETS" rel=noopener>https://opensea.io/assets/emblem-vault-matic?search[resultModel]=ASSETS</a></p><p><a href=https://crystalsuite.com/store/ rel=noopener>https://crystalsuite.com/store/</a></p><p><strong>Sources and other useful links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.orbexplorer.com/collection/?collection=eSog" rel=noopener>https://www.orbexplorer.com/collection/?collection=eSog</a></p><p><a href=https://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com/post/116644097515/what-is-an-fdcard rel=noopener>https://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com/post/116644097515/what-is-an-fdcard</a></p><p><a href=https://bitcoinist.com/moonga-spells-genesis-taking-cryptocurrency-online-gaming/ rel=noopener>https://bitcoinist.com/moonga-spells-genesis-taking-cryptocurrency-online-gaming/</a></p><p><a href=https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-mobile-gaming-spells-of-genesis-bitcrystals rel=noopener>https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-mobile-gaming-spells-of-genesis-bitcrystals</a></p><h1 id=6-etheria-v11-29-oct-2015><strong>6.

Etheria was launched just 3 months after Ethereum went live.</p><p>Etheria was also the first decentralized world on Ethereum, and the first virtual real estate which could be owned as NFTs (the first of many tokenized virtual worlds and the first virtual real estate that has now a booming market across many games). In Etheria players can own land tiles, farm them for blocks, and build things — although this utility has been significantly hampered by high gas costs.</p><p>Etheria v1.0 was an early buggy contract that did not have the functionality to be effectively traded.</p><p>Etheria v1.1 was the first set of NFTs on Ethereum that could be owned and traded.</p><p>Etheria v1.2 was tokenized 2 days later with some minor changes and is designated as the Etheria that is being further developed by the founder.</p><p>The founder of Etheria has previously acknowledged that v1.1 is the “first 3rd-party tradeable NFT” on Ethereum, and v1.2 is the “living version of Etheria that everything will flow from”. (20/3/2021 discord)</p><p>Unfortunately, there has been other unhelpful rhetoric about these assets and an attempt by some to diminish and suppress the value of v1.1. One can only assume this derision may be due to a fear that the v1.1 assets could be considered of greater value by the market than v1.2 given that it is an earlier contract. However, it stands to reason that both versions 1.1 and 1.2 have significant historical value. Both exist independently in a decentralized form on the Ethereum blockchain. Both can be owned and traded.</p><p>In regards to Etheria v1.1, even if the Etheria founder takes these assets no further, any developer in the future could develop other visualizations, a wrap and marketplaces to interact with the contract. There has been some indication that work in this regard may already be underway. Given the history-making status of these unique assets, it is reasonable to postulate that these will forever be highly sought after.</p><p>Who knows, given its rarity and historical status Etheria may become the most expensive real estate (physical or digital) in the world…?</p><p><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum</p><p><strong>Issuance:</strong></p><p>Etheria v1.1 and v 1.2 are each made up of 420 NFT assets of different rarities. i.e. The ice, mountains, and islands are significantly more scarce than the hills, grass and sand plots.</p><p><strong>Current Prices:</strong></p><p>Prices vary according to the location and attributes of the land.

Rare Pepes</strong> (9 Sep 2016)</h1><p>The significance of this project to the birth of cryptoart cannot be overstated. This unique and innovative project largely defined the concept of tokenized cryptoart as we understand it today and is credited with spawning the global cryptoart movement. Going beyond the early individual experimental work that had tokenized artwork on Namecoin, the Rare Pepe project engaged and captured the imagination of a community of artists, enthusiasts and collectors around the world.</p><p>Also, as distinct from Spells of Genesis and other emerging projects, Rare Pepe was the first to demonstrate the use of blockchain for a community of enthusiasts to create, own and trade art simply as ‘art’ (ie. not assets for gaming use or any broader utility).</p><p>There is such a rich history to this project which one cannot do justice to in this short summary, therefore some resources are provided below for those wishing to understand this more. In a nutshell, a number of early innovators (Rare Pepe Scientists) led by
<a href=https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf rel=noopener>Joe Looney</a>
provided an opportunity for artists/individuals to submit ‘dank’ Pepes to be included in the RarePepe collection. These crowdsourced submissions were reviewed by the ‘Rare Pepe Scientists’ who took a light-touch approach to curating the collection — accepting those that were sufficiently ‘dank’ and were not offensive to the peace loving values of the Rare Pepe community. These Rare Pepes were tokenized to bitcoin using the Counterparty Platform and were made available to be purchased through the user-friendly
<a href=https://rarepepewallet.com/ rel=noopener>RarePepeWallet</a>
. Many of the Rare Pepe cards have imagery that draws on pop culture and provides cultural and/or political commentary (usually with much satire) regarding key historical moments.</p><p>There are over 1700 Rare Pepes, divided into 36 different series. The rarity of each card varies greatly from 1/1s to those which have multiple zeros well beyond any numerical name I am familiar with (!). However, the center of the bell curve sits around the 100–300 issuance levels, and some cards have also been subject to significant burn reductions.</p><p>Some of most valuable cards include the

Most believe that the NFT space has been quietly working away largely out of the site of the ‘mainstream’ until the very recent broader media reports and interest (in 2021).</p><p>However, in 2016/17 there was a Japanese TV Show that aired in Tokyo and surrounding area (14.3 million households) featuring young Japanese women known as ‘BitGirls’ Episodes air on a weekly basis, and participants could use Torekabu-nushi (Trading-share-card holders) to cast votes after each episode. The voting included having the girls wear different costumes and changing standing positions during each show. Each girl’s performance on TV would affect her popularity, thus increasing or decreasing the value of her token, and influencing viewers’ trading behaviors.</p><p>The new TV series included a crowdfunding event whereby participants purchased voting tokens. Investors could then trade the BitGirls currency on the Zaif exchange. This early innovative approach was effectively one of the earliest forms of ICOs or governance tokens before it had even been given the term.</p><p>There are 26 x BitGirls assets, each with a supply between 500–1000. Many of these assets remain in the original central wallet and it is unkown if anyone still has access to this.

The company was founded in 1988 as a family business and then bought out by Collectable Brands in 2017.</p><p>The interesting history behind this one is that EverdreamSoft and Collectable DieCast shared an office building during this early innovation period. After coming to understand each other’s business, it was agreed that an attempt would be made to transition the interest of collectors from the traditional physical medium to the digital realm by tokenizing them to the BTC blockchain via Counterparty.</p><p>Needless to say, this innovation was very early for the market at the time, and the customer profile of DieCast Collectables was not exactly made up of ‘digital natives’. Therefore, the DieCast digital collectables were created, but did not take off at the time.</p><p>However, these early digital treasures remain tokenized to bitcoin and are now being unearthed by savvy collectors and digital archeologists. These DieCast collectables are historically significant in that they represent one of the earliest attempts to transition a well-established traditional collectors’ domain from physical to digital assets in this very early emergence period.</p><p>To appreciate how early this innovation attempt was, one must consider that these assets even pre-date other very early innovations such as curio cards, cryptopunks and cryptokitties.</p><p>In order to draw attention to these assets and reward users, EverdreamSoft partnered with
<a href=https://twitter.com/MandelDuck rel=noopener>@Mandelduck</a>
and coordinated an innovative distribution of some of these assets in connection with a geocaching app called Takara.

<a href=https://larvalabs.com/ rel=noopener>Larva Labs</a>
have become the ‘face’ of the NFT market.</p><p>“The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed.

<a href=https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks rel=noopener>https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks</a></p><p>Cryptopunks are credited as inspiring the ERC721 standard, but are in fact an early standard. Cryptopunks are highly technologically and culturally significant and have largely inspired the plethora of the ‘PFP’ (Profile Picture) projects that have followed since.</p><p>However, there has unfortunately been an erroneous narrative about these being the first ever NFTs. This incorrect narrative quickly gained traction and has overshadowed awareness of the earlier innovative projects that came before it. However, the broader market is now starting to realize this as the facts and history become known.</p><p>As described above, there is no debating that Etheria was the first NFT on Ethereum, and this was created significantly earlier (almost 2 years). Even earlier than this, NameCoin hosted a number of NFTs and the earliest form of PFPs (Profile Pictures).</p><p>Furthermore, RarePepes had also established a community-sourced set of tokenized assets (including some 1 of 1 NFTs) considerably earlier than the release of cryptopunks.</p><p>The re-discovery of these facts do not in anyway diminish the value of cryptopunks, but rather, it simply results in additional value and credit also being directed to the other early innovations than came before it.</p><p><strong>Chain:</strong></p><p>Ethereum</p><p><strong>Current Prices:</strong></p><p>Floor at time of writing is 83 ETH</p><p><strong>Markets to purchase asset:</strong></p><p><a href=https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks rel=noopener>https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks</a></p><p><a href=https://opensea.io/collection/wrapped-cryptopunks rel=noopener>https://opensea.io/collection/wrapped-cryptopunks</a></p><p><strong>Sources and Other useful links:</strong></p><p>Various articles linked here:

In also explored the ways the separation changes a collector’s relationship to art.</p><p>The Digital Zones tell a story about how different concepts of ownership are fundamental to the experience of an artwork. The artwork — and the 33-page essay which accompanied it — speculated that if, at some point in the future, artworks were owned and transacted through immaterial blockchain tokens, that shift in the commodity form of the artwork could also precipitate a shift in the material (or immaterial form) of the artwork.”</p><p><a href=https://chan.gallery/ikb/ rel=noopener>https://chan.gallery/ikb/</a></p><p><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum</p><p><strong>Current Prices:</strong></p><p>Floor price at time of writing is 115 ETH.</p><p><strong>Markets to purchase asset:</strong></p><p><a href=https://opensea.io/collection/ikb-cachet-de-garantie-1 rel=noopener>https://opensea.io/collection/ikb-cachet-de-garantie-1</a></p><p><strong>Sources and Other useful links:</strong></p><p><a href=https://chan.gallery/ikb/ rel=noopener>https://chan.gallery/ikb/</a></p><h1 id=19-mooncat-rescue-9-aug-2017><strong>19.

Only 100 rocks can ever be available with are of varying shades of colour. The buying and selling of rocks is managed via the Ethereum blockchain with a decentralized smart contract.</p><p>Soon after having launched the project was largely forgotten until very recently. Users quickly minted the remaining rocks still available via the contract.</p><p>The website advises that these rocks serve no purpose beyond being able to be bought and sold, “and giving you a strong sense of pride in being an owner of 1 of the only 100 rocks in the game :)”. The developer has recently said that very little effort went into the rock pictures themselves and that he only built the contract and website in order to practice using solidity (the Ethereum coding language) which he was learning at the time.</p><p>It is fair to say that these very dull and useless rocks have sent the market wild, with rocks being sold for over $2M at the time of writing! Aside from this being a vintage project there appears to be something very appealing to the crypto-market to be able to own one of these elite and expensive assets which in its simplicity so utterly offends the sensibilities of the ‘pre-NFT’ world.</p><p><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum</p><p><strong>Issuance:</strong></p><p>100 rocks of various shades of color.</p><p><strong>Current Prices:</strong></p><p>The floor price at the time of writing is: 500 ETH.</p><p><strong>Markets to purchase asset:</strong></p><p>The rocks can only be purchased on the original website that the current time:

Cryptobots (29 Dec 2017)</h1><p>Just sneaking into the 2017 year, cryptobots appears to have become quite a popular game in early 2018 whereby bots could be purchased and battled. Apparently the more expensive bots were selling for over 100 ETH each at its peak. This project had been lost for a while but is now being revived.</p><p>Still only a limited amount is known, and no doubt futher history will emerge on this project.</p><p><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum</p><p><strong>Issuance:</strong></p><p>9,300 (To be confirmed)</p><p><strong>Current Prices:</strong></p><p>Floor is 0.07 at time of writing, with prices varying according to attributes/rarity.</p><p><strong>Markets to purchase asset:</strong></p><p><a href=https://opensea.io/collection/cryptobots rel=noopener>https://opensea.io/collection/cryptobots</a></p><p><strong>Sources and other useful links:</strong></p><p><a href=https://medium.com/@cryptobots rel=noopener>https://medium.com/@cryptobots</a></p><p><a href=https://cryptoclarified.com/cryptobots-selling-for-over-200000-dollars-how-to-play-earn/ rel=noopener>https://cryptoclarified.com/cryptobots-selling-for-over-200000-dollars-how-to-play-earn/</a></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*Xf-uqmuJawquKTv-h6qKQA.jpeg?q=20" alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/625/1*Xf-uqmuJawquKTv-h6qKQA.jpeg alt></p><h1 id=30-realms-of-ether-30-dec-2017>30. Realms of Ether (30 Dec 2017)</h1><p>Finally, the last known project that slid into dying days of the 2017 year was the Realms of Ether game.</p><p>This one look like a pretty innovative gaming project in which players can own fortresses, farm resources, attach other players, create buildings and recrute troops. The game is still playable.</p><p>As with many projects, the game appears to have been buried during the 2018 bear market and has only recently been rediscovered with much enthusiasm.</p><p>There is a useful summary on the site’s twitter thread which is adapted here:</p><p>Realms of Ether was launched by a single anonymous developer on December 30, 2017 in a Bitcointalk forum post. The game attracted initial interest with 25 posts in the launch thread and a handful of Fortresses minted over the first month.</p><p>The developer intended the project to be fully open-source and provided Github links plus a Medium post detailing their experiences developing the game.</p><p>In early August 2021, the game was uncovered and a wide range of collectors began to mint the remaining Fortresses. Minting capped out at 500 and the collectors banded together in Telegram to figure out next steps.</p><p>Efforts to find the dev have not been successful to date, therefore the community engaged other devs who were able to utilise the existing code and contract to develop a working wrapper for OpenSea trading.</p><p><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum</p><p><strong>Issuance:</strong></p><p>500 Assets (TBC)</p><p><strong>Current Prices:</strong></p><p>Floor at time of writing is 2.9 ETH</p><p><strong>Markets to purchase asset:</strong></p><p><a href=https://opensea.io/collection/realms-of-ether-1 rel=noopener>https://opensea.io/collection/realms-of-ether-1</a></p><p><strong>Sources and other useful links:</strong></p><p><a href=https://realms-of-ether.github.io/ rel=noopener>https://realms-of-ether.github.io/</a></p><p><a href=https://medium.com/@ethergames/developing-and-running-a-game-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-1-5fd8bcd7fb8b rel=noopener>https://medium.com/@ethergames/developing-and-running-a-game-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-1-5fd8bcd7fb8b</a></p><p><a href="https://t.co/kMOUSv9SVI?amp=1" rel=noopener>discord.gg/K4XmQ6fYHy</a></p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/realms_of_ether rel=noopener>https://twitter.com/realms_of_ether</a></p><h1 id=31-2018-onwards--various-projects><strong>31. 2018 Onwards — Various Projects</strong></h1><p>From 2018 onwards, the number of assets and platforms began to increase significantly. I have not listed these projects along with the various early pioneering artists and developers as I would inevitably miss some and not give sufficient recognition where it is due. However, the following projects from 2018/19 onwards are provided as a point of reference in the timeline given their high profile and significance in expanding the adoption of and interest in NFT technology.</p><p><strong>32. Axie Infinity</strong> (Feb 2018)</p><p><strong>33. Autogyphs</strong> (April 2019)</p><p><strong>34. NBA Top Shots</strong> (July 2019)</p><p>These projects are well known and easily researched. The focus of this article is to provide information and insight relating to the digital antiquities of the very early NFT emergence period 2014 -2017.</p><h1 id=final-words>Final Words</h1><p>Finally, I often get asked, ‘what are the grail assets from the early NFT emergence period’? So here they are. I have idenitified the following as elite grail assets due to the degree to which they represented a significant socio-cultural or technical ‘first’ within NFT / blockchain history:</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*c2iUOmRN3ThJc9VLWbzUgA.png?q=20" alt></p><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*c2iUOmRN3ThJc9VLWbzUgA.png alt></p><p>Golden & Silver Emergence Eras — Grail Assets (2014–2017)</p><p>Collecting these beautiful vintage assets is a lot of fun and they bring much joy.</p><p>However beyond just the fun, it is also to our advantage to realise that we are in a very unique emergence period of a world changing asset class. Therefore the mindset to my collecting is to ask myself ‘what NFTs have historical significance so that their value will be anchored to something firm that is beyond the immediate volatility of market fads and passing fancies?’</p><p>Taking it a step further… if I were about to travel back in time to when the very first baseball cards were being released, what would I do? Of course I would scoop up as many as I could because I would know the value that is to come.</p><p>The new digital asset class that is emerging before our very eyes is far more significant than baseball cards, and it will have world changing impacts. The assets listed in the above timeline are the very first of their kind and I contend that they will be highly sought after as part of a broader digital antiquities market that will continue to be trading many years into the future (NFA). Therefore right now I believe we have a ‘glut’ of very rare and historically significant NFTs, which will soon disperse and I expect will substantially increase in value and scarcity over time (I have written in more depth about the framework that I apply to assess the longterm value of NFTs

).</p><p>It is my hope that the information provided helps you make good decisions as an NFT collector and that it brings great benefit to you, your family and your community. I also hope that the information provided contributes to a more accurate narrative about the emergence of NFTs and helps to ensure that due recognition is given to those early innovators who saw things well before any of us, and took action to build this space we now enjoy.</p><p>Please leave a comment or
